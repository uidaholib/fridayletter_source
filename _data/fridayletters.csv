<p>Dear Friends of the University of Idaho,<br>
<br>
In case we haven’t met, please let me introduce myself:<strong> I’m Don Burnett.&nbsp;</strong>I began serving as our university’s interim president this week and will continue to do so while we look for a permanent successor to Duane Nellis, who has departed to become the president of Texas Tech University.</p>
<p>I’m an Idaho native, born to parents who grew up in Wallace, Idaho, and who attended the University of Idaho during the Great Depression. I’m told that they rocked me to sleep with the lullaby of “Go Vandals Go.” As biologists would say, I was “imprinted” as a Vandal.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Depression-era students at the University had little money (my mother gladly started work in the library at 35 cents an hour), but they did not feel poor because they were “all in it together.”&nbsp; For them, the University of Idaho was the gateway to the world. And so it should be for our students today.<strong> I’m committed to the life-changing opportunities that come through our commitment to education.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I’m also committed to proclaiming the legacy of our university as one of the nation’s great public institutions of higher education.</strong>&nbsp; You know, of course, that we are Idaho’s only national land-grant institution. You may not know that we are also part of the distinctive “first family” of American land-grant institutions that were established as the founding comprehensive universities of their respective states, and that our university is enshrined in the state constitution. </p>
<p>This<strong> unique heritage as both a land-grant institution and a comprehensive founding university places us in the company of great public institutions</strong> like the University of Wisconsin and University of Minnesota. These universities are powerhouses that have boosted the economies and bettered the lives of people in their respective states. They (and we) are the highest expression of one of America’s most transformative ideas: the land-grant university system.</p>
<p>I am humbled by the call to leave the deanship of our College of Law and to serve the entire university as interim president. &nbsp;(By the way, there is a “precedent” for this:&nbsp; The University of Idaho’s first president, James A. Forney, was also a lawyer and a judge, who agreed to serve on an interim appointment!)&nbsp; Today, some twelve decades later, I will endeavor as a servant of the entire University to work with all members of the academic community, and with all friends and stakeholders of the University, to fulfill our distinctive mission and destiny.</p>
<p><strong>I’m also glad to be serving with my wife Karen</strong>, who is a very talented graduate of the University of Idaho’s Master of Fine Arts (Creative Writing) program and an active participant in our community.&nbsp; She’s an author and photographer who has also committed herself to a leadership role in Operation Education – our acclaimed scholarship program for veterans.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Historians have exalted the University of Idaho as a “beacon for mountain and plain,” emanating from a “crested hill.”&nbsp; Next year, when we celebrate the 125th birthday of our university -- Idaho’s founding university – and, as we anticipate the successful culmination of our “Inspiring Futures” Capital Campaign, let it be proclaimed that from this crested hill the beacon for mountain and plain has never shown more brightly.</p>
<p>I’m honored to serve with you in this great endeavor.&nbsp; We are all truly “in it together.”</p>
<p>Go Vandals … go mighty Vandals!</p>

<p><strong>Idaho Barley Commission Joins With CALS To Create Endowed Professorship.</strong> After a nine-month feasibility assessment and a unanimous vote of support, the Idaho Barley Commission recently entered into a joint venture with the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences to create the “Idaho Barley Agronomy Professorship Endowment.""&nbsp;This $1 million endowment creates a position at the University’s Aberdeen Research and Extension Center dedicated to barley agronomy. Endowed professorships like this exist in perpetuity, guaranteeing that this research position will forever benefit barley research in Idaho. Pat Purdy, IBC vice chairman and barley grower from Picabo, is a strong supporter of strengthening barley research within the University of Idaho and the Agricultural Research Service. “As Idaho barley growers, we are constantly faced with new challenges that are putting pressure on our bottom line profit,” said Purdy. “To help growers face these challenges, we need the research efforts and field work that only a dedicated barley scientist with the University of Idaho can provide, and this endowment will guarantee that such a position is permanently in place. “The IBC is a self-governing agency that serves to enhance the profitability of the Idaho barley growers through research, market development, promotion, information and education.

2013-07-12,,"<img src=""../images/friday-letter-header.jpg"" alt=""Friday Letter Office of the President""><h1 class=""PageTitle "">July 12</h1><div class=""bodyCopy"">
<p class=""p1"">Dear Friends of the University of Idaho,</p>
<p class=""p1"">In my introductory “Friday Letter,” I highlighted our university’s distinctive place in American higher education. We are a national land-grant institution that is also the state’s founding, comprehensive, and constitutionally established university. This cluster of distinctions gives authentic, history-based meaning to our proclaimed “legacy of leading.”</p>
<p class=""p1"">A distinctive legacy connotes a high calling — and carries a profound responsibility.&nbsp;<strong>The University of Idaho is expected to be preeminent in shaping and shepherding Idaho’s progress in post-secondary education. Our leadership role includes enlisting the collaboration of sister institutions and eliciting the support of partners in the public and private sectors.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">These relationships enable us to lead with strength. From time to time in the “Friday Letter,” I will invite your attention to the power of such relationships. Today I focus on our long-standing alliance with the agricultural industry.</p>
<p class=""p1"">American agriculture leads the world – and feeds much of it.&nbsp; Here in Idaho, agribusiness is our state’s largest single economic sector, accounting for 18 percent of total output. In 2012,&nbsp;<strong>for the third consecutive year, Idaho agriculture broke cash receipt and net income records.</strong>&nbsp;This success reflects hard work, sound business planning in a dynamic global economy, and strategic investments in science and technology.</p>
<p class=""p1"">These investments are the products of a partnership between industry and the academy.&nbsp; In the last year alone, nearly $15 million has been committed by agricultural entities to the&nbsp;<strong>University of Idaho’s College of Agricultural and Life Sciences.&nbsp;</strong>For example, the<strong>Idaho Barley Commission</strong>&nbsp;has finalized the details of a $1 million endowment for barley agronomy research that will benefit the nearly 1,500 barley producers statewide. To date, the&nbsp;<strong>Idaho Wheat Commission</strong>&nbsp;has invested nearly $4.5 million in our efforts to breed wheat and improve crop management practices. This includes the endowment of two faculty research professorships in January 2012.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Likewise, our partnership in furthering potato production, processing and storage has led the<strong>&nbsp;Idaho Potato Commission&nbsp;</strong>to donate more than $4 million to efforts like thwarting the zebra chip bacteria and other threats to potato crops.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Several of these commodity commissions have also joined with<strong>&nbsp;J.R. Simplot Compan</strong>y to help save our research stations in Parma and Tetonia, which had been marked for closure because of state education budget cuts. Recognizing the need for unbiased research and grassroots outreach to help Idaho growers continue to thrive in production and processing, Simplot has continued to invest in operations and research led by the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences as a means to help Idaho growers thrive.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Our efforts in animal science also have been recognized with more than $1 million from the&nbsp;<strong>United Dairymen of Idaho&nbsp;</strong>and nearly $1 million from the&nbsp;<strong>Idaho Beef Council.</strong>&nbsp;These contributions help support efforts to improve breeding, herd management, beef production, food safety, and more. Forthcoming collaborations likely will include development of best practices in livestock operations efficiency and solutions for environmental issues, as well as exploration of potential energy sources that can be derived from livestock operations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p1"">Our generous partners know that investments in cooperation have made a critical difference between success and failure for agriculture across our state.&nbsp; They also understand that such investments derive their long-term value from industry support for academic rigor and objective scientific inquiry.&nbsp;<strong>Progressive thinking has made Idaho one of the nation’s fastest developing states in agriculture, and has made the University of Idaho an engine of that growth.</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">Think about that when you sit down to your next meal.&nbsp;It’s a tangible illustration of our university’s legacy of leading.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Sincerely,</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong><em>Don Burnett&nbsp;</em></strong><br>
Interim President</p>

<p class=""p1""><strong>College of Graduate Studies Sees Jump in Applicants</strong>. As the University of Idaho is making plans for the fall semester, staff and faculty are making room for more graduate students. Fall admissions for graduate applications are up by 2 percent, along with a 4 percent increase in admitted students. International applicants have seen an increase by 10 percent. While graduate students come from almost 80 countries. Diversity graduate applicants are also up 29 percent.&nbsp;Both the College of Science and the College of Engineering have increased numbers of applications at both the master’s degree and doctoral degree level. The College of Art and Architecture has also seen a significant rise in applications and admits -- up 25 percent over last year in applications.</p>
<p class=""p4""><strong>Research Project Explores Socioeconomic Aspects of Bioenergy Development.&nbsp;</strong>The Office of Community Partnerships is launching a research project to better understand the potential socioeconomic effects of using forest biomass to produce energy with a $350,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture. The project’s goal is to determine the benefits and costs of participating in future liquid biofuel production by looking at existing forest biomass availability and community priorities. Researchers also will compare alternative scenarios for forest biomass use to better understand strategies to maximize benefits to their area economies and people.&nbsp;<a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/idaho.imodules.com/redirect.aspx?linkID=11804&amp;eid=71205']);"" href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20150907121117/http://idaho.imodules.com/redirect.aspx?linkID=11804&amp;eid=71205"" target=""_blank""><strong>Read more.</strong></a></p>
<p class=""p4""><strong>UI Biologist Heads Summer Research to Increase Salmon, Trout and Lamprey.</strong>&nbsp;In an effort to boost stocks of steelhead trout, Chinook salmon and Pacific lamprey, a team of University of Idaho researchers will begin a three-faceted study in the coming months. A $2.7 million grant from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is supporting the work. Co-investigator Christopher Caudill is an assistant professor in the department of fish and wildlife sciences in Moscow. He said three related studies would be conducted on the Federal Columbia River Power System, the Snake River and on the Willamette River, all of which are affected by dams. The projects, which fall under a federal program launched in 1997, will include a blend of engineering ingenuity, fish telemetry and underwater acoustic camera monitors.&nbsp;<a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/idaho.imodules.com/redirect.aspx?linkID=11802&amp;eid=71205']);"" href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20150907121117/http://idaho.imodules.com/redirect.aspx?linkID=11802&amp;eid=71205"" target=""_blank""><strong>Read more.</strong></a></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Educators Give to Help Future Educators In Perpetuity.</strong>&nbsp;Marilyn French ’62 and her husband, Carter, together have spent more than five decades educating youths. To continue their support of education in perpetuity, the Frenches have endowed a scholarship fund for students studying in the University of Idaho’s College of Education. “We think education is very important,” she said. The Marilyn and Carter French College of Education scholarship will provide approximately $1,000 each year to a student pursuing a degree in elementary education. The first scholarship will be awarded for the 2014-2015 school year. “The University of Idaho gave me the start in education,” Marilyn said. “Both my husband and I have earned a living in teaching.” Marilyn and Carter, a Washington State University graduate, believed it was the right choice to give back to her alma mater. Marilyn, originally from Lewiston, also has a family tie to the University. Her late brother, Richard Loeppky, PhD, also attended the University of Idaho and was inducted into the University’s Hall of Fame.

<p>Dear Alumni and Friends,&nbsp;<br>
<br>
When you next have an opportunity to visit our campus in Moscow (I especially recommend visiting in the autumn, when the Palouse bursts forth with stunning colors), please take a moment to view an inscription at the entrance to the Administration Building. There you will read that the “Commonwealth of Idaho” has established our university “for the training of Idaho’s future citizens to their highest usefulness in private life and public service.” Those words proclaim a mission that is more than a century old, yet as modern as today.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Last week, our Board of Regents (the Idaho State Board of Education) took positive action on several line item appropriation requests that will help us fulfill our mission:</p>
<ul style=""margin-top: 0in;"">
    <li style=""text-align: left;"">The State Board recognized our need to recruit faculty and staff competitively, and to retain talented individuals who have received only one modest salary adjustment in the past six years. Many of these mission-essential people are being courted by other institutions. It was heartening, therefore, to see the State Board last week recommend that the Governor submit and the Legislature approve a fully funded “CEC” (change of employee compensation) for higher education faculty and staff, along with other state employees.</li>
</ul>
<ul style=""margin-top: 0in;"">
    <li style=""text-align: left;"">The Board, recognizing that our mission requires safe and up-to-date facilities, voted to recommend funding of deferred maintenance based upon a formula of demonstrated need. This will especially benefit our university, which has Idaho’s oldest and largest campus system, with a correspondingly large inventory of unfunded repair and renovation projects.</li>
</ul>
<ul style=""margin-top: 0in;"">
    <li style=""text-align: left;"">The Board, underscoring the importance of its “Complete College Idaho” initiative, voted to recommend an appropriation that will enable all of Idaho’s higher education institutions to hire new faculty, staff, teaching assistants or advisers for the purpose of improving access to, and student success in, post-secondary programs.</li>
</ul>
<ul style=""margin-top: 0in;"">
    <li style=""text-align: left;"">The Board also voted to recommend an appropriation that will strengthen our College of Law in its fulfillment of the University of Idaho’s historic statewide mission in legal education. This appropriation will support faculty, staff, and operations related to offering second-year law classes (in addition to existing third-year classes) at Boise. The Board approved the second-year curriculum last year, and the Board is now helping the university secure the resources necessary to implement it.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Why is the College of Law item important? Law graduates go not only into the practice of law but also into other careers such as entrepreneurship, corporate management, education, public administration, and civic leadership. Because the Juris Doctor degree is so versatile, enhancing the curricular opportunities available to students will amplify the University of Idaho’s service to the state while elevating the attractiveness and competitiveness of our law program.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The College’s curricular design – which PreLaw Magazine recently called one of the top 25 innovations in American legal education – anchors the full three-year, Juris Doctor curriculum in Moscow. Upper-division courses will be offered where there is a locational advantage. For example, natural resources and environmental law will continue to be a curricular emphasis in Moscow, drawing upon the assets of our land-grant research campus. Business law will be a curricular emphasis in Boise, drawing upon the assets of Idaho’s largest metropolitan commercial center. These complementary locations will be (and already are) connected by distance education technology. Students will be able to enjoy access to opportunities at the location(s) best suited to their subject-matter interests and their personal or family needs.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Our primary objective in providing these opportunities is not to increase overall law school enrollment; indeed, the enrollment impact is expected to be modest. Rather, the primary purpose is qualitative -- to serve our students better and to fulfill our statewide mission more completely.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">This is but one&nbsp;<a name=""_GoBack""></a>example of the University of Idaho’s legacy of leading. It illustrates how Idaho’s founding university, with help from our Board of Regents, is delivering on the historic promise of “training … Idaho’s future citizens to their highest usefulness in private life and public service.”</p>

Dear Friends of the University of Idaho,<br>
<br>
“All our lives through, we’ll go singing, singing of you, singing of Idaho.”
<p>For the Vandal family, these words -- often accompanied by the memory of melodic chimes emanating from the Administration Building tower – exemplify a unique bond between our university and the State of Idaho. The words are found in the official state song, adopted in 1931; yet they originated, as did the melody, in the chorus of our University’s alma mater, written by a University of Idaho student and sung proudly by Vandals since 1917.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Singing of Idaho” is, at once, an accolade to a beautiful state and to its founding university.&nbsp;For nearly 125 years, this university – Idaho’s national land-grant, comprehensive, constitutional university! – has established a legacy of leading in research, teaching, and outreach that extends across Idaho, the American West, and beyond.&nbsp;Our university truly is, in the memorable phrase of historian&nbsp;<a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/Manuscripts/mg350.htm']);"" href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20150907061552/http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/Manuscripts/mg350.htm"">Rafe Gibbs</a>, a “beacon for mountain and plain.”</p>
<p>A new academic year beckons.&nbsp;In Moscow and at our other statewide campuses, there is a crackle of energy as nearly 13,000 graduate and undergraduate students – including nearly 3,000 new arrivals – open their books and iPads, engage our faculty (and each other) in a quest for discovery and understanding, and advance in personal pathways toward fulfilling careers.&nbsp;The students will make lifetime friends in classrooms and laboratories, in varsity and intramural sports, in clubs and residence halls and in a host of other gathering places.

<p>The University of Idaho cultivates the whole person. To our new students we say, you have chosen well.&nbsp;Now, take advantage of every enriching opportunity our leading university provides.&nbsp;Study conscientiously.&nbsp;Live vigorously.&nbsp;Grow joyously.</p>

<p><strong>Graduate Repays A Family Debt With Two College Investments.&nbsp;</strong>Robert D. Dixon ’70, ’71 recently committed a $50,000 gift divided between the College of Business and Economics and a scholarship named in honor of his brother Dennis to benefit students in the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences. Dixon lives in Hillsborough, Calif. and is a managing director of the Menlo Park office of Morgan Stanley. He divides his time between his work in California and his second profession -- managing a cattle ranch in Montana. Dixon, an Idaho Falls native, credits the University of Idaho with “having a great deal to do with whatever success I have had professionally” and cites this as his reason for giving back. Dixon has been named one of the top 10 financial advisers in the United States according to Barron’s. Dean Mario Reyes says the entire college takes great pride in Dixon’s accomplishments. “I cannot thank Bob enough for his generous support. He is an inspiration, and we look forward to introducing him to our current students who aspire to following a similar professional path.” For information about making a gift to the College of Business and Economics, please contact Chandra Ford at (208) 890-2370 or&nbsp;<a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/email/mailto:chandra@uidaho.edu']);"" href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20150907061552/mailto:chandra@uidaho.edu"">chandra@uidaho.edu</a>.&nbsp;</p></div>"

Dear Friends,<br>
<br>
Innovation and creativity have long characterized the American experience. Our nation, and the world, can thank innovators from Idaho for creations such as television, invented by Philo Farnsworth, of Rigby, among others; for vehicle back-up warning systems, from Ed Peterson of Boise; and for life-sustaining respirators made by Forrest Bird of Sagle.&nbsp;
<p>Many science-based innovations, like these, are products of brilliant individual creativity. They are also the products, directly or indirectly, of a broad foundation of scientific discovery and knowledge fostered by the nation’s research universities and private research laboratories. The University of Idaho – our national land-grant, founding, comprehensive and constitutional university -- stands tall in this distinguished company.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet we face a challenge: America now has an “innovation deficit.” Consider the following facts reported by the Association of Public &amp; Land-Grant Universities</p>
<ul>
    <li>Over the last 10 years, research and development expenditures as a share of economic output have remained nearly constant in the United States but have increased by nearly 50 percent in South Korea and nearly 90 percent in China.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>From 1996 to 2007, U.S. R&amp;D expenditures grew by an average of 5.8 percent annually. During the same time period, China’s average annual growth was 21.9 percent. During the first year of the economic slowdown from 2008 to 2009, U.S. expenditures decreased slightly while China’s increased by 27 percent.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>During the 1960s the United States devoted up to 17 percent of federal discretionary spending on R&amp;D -- in part due to the space program -- resulting in a prodigious amount of spinoff innovation; in recent years, however, outlays have fallen to around 9 percent.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>By 2010, fewer than 50 percent of U.S. patents were being granted to U.S. entities.</li>
</ul>
<p>These trends threaten America’s position as the world’s innovation leader. Our prosperity has been built upon public and private investment – and today we need more of both. Even the most ardent advocates for limited government, such as columnist George Will, have expressed concern about the dwindling public investment in R&amp;D.</p>
<p>Here in Idaho, Governor Butch Otter and the legislature have taken an important step toward addressing the issue, by connecting public university research with economic development through the Idaho Global Entrepreneurial Mission program. Under this program, University of Idaho faculty and students are engaged in research on emerging green technologies such as bio-cement, aquatic animal health products, increased safety and efficiency of pesticide applications, software capable of recognizing bacterial colony growth and high-speed digital memory modules.</p>
<p>These research efforts will produce jobs and prosperity in the future. They illustrate the University of Idaho’s growing importance to our state and nation.</p>
<p>Go Vandals!</p>

<div style=""text-align: left;"">Dear Friends, <br>
</div>
<p>As I write this, the sunlight of a warm autumn day is shining on Memorial Gym, one of the most photographed buildings on our Moscow campus.&nbsp; The “memorial” reminds us of soldiers who have given their lives for our country. Tomorrow, in ceremonies on the Administration Building lawn and at the Kibbie Dome, the University of Idaho will salute the men and women who have served, and are now serving, in the U.S. Armed Forces. We do so respectfully and gratefully.</p>
<p>In an open and democratic society, as Professor Richard Kohn (University of North Carolina/Chapel Hill) has noted, “the purpose of the military is to defend society, not to define it.”&nbsp; Our men and women in uniform serve at the direction of civilian authority. They go into harm’s way when and where we ask them to do so. Their service is an extraordinary blend of valor, constraint, and selflessness.</p>
<p>America has nearly 22 million living veterans and service members, with nearly 1.3 million currently deployed worldwide. Behind these men and women are families and friends who endure more sacrifice than many of us realize. All of them merit respectful recognition.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In Idaho, our veterans include Medal of Honor recipients Marine Col. “Pappy” Boyington from Coeur d’ Alene, and Air Force Col. “Bernie” Fisher from Kuna, whose acts of bravery have been well documented. Throughout history, other recipients of this distinctive honor have included Army PFC William Nakamura, who was forcibly detained at the Minidoka internment camp in southern Idaho at the outset of World War II, yet who later served with the famed 442nd Regimental Combat Team – the most decorated unit in the history of the U.S. Army.</p>
<p>Many more of our sons and daughters are missing in action or have been taken prisoner. The MIA/POW roster includes University of Idaho graduate Navy Cmdr. Roderick Mayer of Lewiston, whose aircraft was shot down over North Vietnam in 1965, and Ketchum resident Army Sgt. Bowie Bergdahl, who has been held by the Taliban in Afghanistan since 2009. We will remember them in our on-campus ceremonies.&nbsp; We will also recognize the men and women of Idaho’s 116th Armored Cavalry Brigade and 124th Fighter Wing, as well as members of other National Guard, reserve or active duty units.</p>
<p>Many of those who serve in uniform, and are fortunate enough to return home, must cope with the effects of disabilities and disrupted lives. They deserve not only our thanks but our help.&nbsp; The University of Idaho has stepped forward with its <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/idaho.imodules.com/redirect.aspx?linkID=14126&amp;eid=71205']);"" href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20150907062213/http://idaho.imodules.com/redirect.aspx?linkID=14126&amp;eid=71205"" target=""_blank"">“Operation Education” program</a>, providing scholarship aid to returning veterans and assistance to their families. Generous supporters have contributed more than $1 million to this effort. Operation Education is one of the reasons why the Military Times has named the University of Idaho one of the top 68 “Best for Vets” four-year institutions in the nation.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I encourage you to join us in saluting our men and women in uniform, past and present – for their unselfish service.&nbsp; </p>

Dear Friends,<br>
<br>
“Moscow has much to toast of, much to be proud of. The legislature made no mistake in locating the University at this point…. its people are intelligent, enterprising and public spirited and, we believe, will spare no pains to make Moscow the Athens of Idaho.”<br>
<br>
<p>This accolade from the Blackfoot News in 1889 may seem a bit florid, but it points to an enduring truth. Like ancient Athens, the city of Moscow, with its broader neighborhood embracing Pullman, offers a unique living and learning community.</p>
<p>Our Moscow-Pullman neighborhood combines a wealth of arts and learning with the benefit of friendly residents, low crime rates, a healthy environment, and an abundance of smart people. The well-known brain-building website Lumosity.com has rated the Moscow-Pullman corridor as the <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/asset1.lumosity.com/smartest-cities-2013/SmartestCities2013.pdf']);"" href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20150907061244/http://asset1.lumosity.com/smartest-cities-2013/SmartestCities2013.pdf"" target=""_blank"">nation’s seventh smartest population </a>center per capita.</p>
<p>We are developing this source of intellectual capital in ways that promote the economy and culture of our state, region, and nation. A shining example is the <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/www.palouseknowledgecorridor.com/']);"" href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20150907061244/http://www.palouseknowledgecorridor.com/"" target=""_blank"">Palouse Knowledge Corridor</a><a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/www.palouseknowledgecorridor.com/']);"" href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20150907061244/http://www.palouseknowledgecorridor.com/"" target=""_blank""></a><a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/www.palouseknowledgecorridor.com/']);"" href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20150907061244/http://www.palouseknowledgecorridor.com/"" target=""_blank"">, </a>which seeks to “match innovation with opportunity” in research, science, and entrepreneurism.&nbsp; Collaborating in this effort are the University of Idaho, City of Moscow, Washington State University, City of Pullman, and a host of other private and public entities. </p>
<p>Our unique neighborhood nurtures the spirit as well as the mind. Outdoor Magazine ranks us among the nation’s top 25 universities for its vibrant community and outdoor recreation. Money, Businessweek, Mother Earth News, and other publications have ranked the larger Palouse community of Moscow and Pullman as a top place to live and to raise a family.</p>
<p>In ancient Athens, youths took an oath to leave their community better than they found it. Today at the University of Idaho, we undertake with our neighbors to inculcate the knowledge, skills, and values that will enable our young people to fulfill a similar purpose in life. Our success is measured by the fact that the University of Idaho has been named to the <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/www.nationalservice.gov/special-initiatives/honor-roll']);"" href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20150907061244/http://www.nationalservice.gov/special-initiatives/honor-roll"" target=""_blank"">President’s Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll</a> every year since its inception in 2006. </p>
<p>In modern life, as in ancient times, place has meaning. Moscow does indeed have “much to toast of, much to be proud of.”&nbsp; We are blessed to live, work, and study here.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Tomorrow our Vandal football team will take the field against the Washington State Cougars. For a few hours we will engage in the vigorous partisanship of a great rivalry.&nbsp; And, when the game is over, we will reaffirm our good fortune to share one of America’s great neighborhoods, nestled in one of the most beautiful corners of the country.</p>
<p>Go Vandals!</p>

<p><strong>Cargill Inspires Futures By Aiding Today’s Scholars.</strong> Cargill – an international producer and marketer of food, agricultural, financial and industrial products and services – has partnered with the University of Idaho to enhance student learning. Cargill’s $25,000 support last year provided a year-long scholarship to Rachael Ashley, now a senior studying animal and veterinary science, who also worked as a summer intern with Cargill. “Rachel did an amazing job for us,” said Roger Eytzen, business development manager for the Pacific NW District of Cargill’s Animal Nutrition Division. “She was a very hard worker, and when we told her something once, it is as good as done. She thinks for herself and adapts well even under pressure.” Ashley said: “It was clear that Cargill is more than a company -- it is a family adding value to the world. And my education prepared me to understand the concepts, and my real-world application at Cargill made those concepts real. This experience will propel my career upon graduation, and I owe it to the team at Cargill. I will forever be grateful for the immense knowledge I’ve gained.” For more information on how your organization can partner with the University of Idaho, contact Mindy Means at (208) 885-7053 or <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/email/mailto:mmeans@uidaho.edu']);"" href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20150907061244/mailto:mmeans@uidaho.edu"">mmeans@uidaho.edu</a>.</p></div>"

                    <p>Dear Friends,</p>
                    <p>This is our homecoming week.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is a time of special nostalgia for me because -- as many of you know by now -- my parents attended the University of Idaho during the Great Depression.<span> </span>As I look around our beautiful Moscow campus, where the leaves are now beginning to display brilliant hues of red and yellow, I feel my parents&rsquo; presence.<span> </span>I see what they must have seen: the tree-lined Hello Walk, the clock tower of the stately Administration Building, the gargoyles of Memorial Gym, the grove of trees&nbsp; planted by President Theodore Roosevelt and other distinguished visitors, and the view of Moscow Mountain shimmering in the distance.&nbsp; </p>
                    <p>For all of us in the Vandal family, homecoming is about remembering our distinctive roots.<span> </span>The Vandal tradition of homecoming was born in 1909 -- the same year the first phase of the then-new Administration Building was completed.<span> </span>The iconic structure was dedicated with the placement of a stone marker reminding future visitors of the university&rsquo;s mission: &ldquo;...the training of Idaho&rsquo;s citizens to their highest usefulness in private life and public service.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>Notably, in that same year, we also dedicated the College of Law and the Department of Forestry. Both would grow in prominence and outreach, along with the University at large. <span></span>This growth is reflected in the 2013 homecoming theme: &ldquo;Vandal Pride &ndash; Planet Wide.&rdquo; With students from more than 100 countries coming to our university, and with Idaho students working across the world, the homecoming theme is an apt reminder of our global influence.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
                    Perhaps no individual has embodied our international identity more fully than the late Philip Habib, a Lebanese-American who left his Brooklyn home to learn forestry at the University of Idaho, where he graduated in 1942.<span> </span>He eventually entered the U.S. Foreign Service, becoming an ambassador and key negotiator in resolving conflicts in Korea, Southeast Asia, Central America, and the Middle East.<span>&nbsp; </span>His success ultimately earned him international acclaim  and a Presidential Medal of Freedom for bringing peace to troubled regions around the globe.<span> </span>The New York Times called him ""the outstanding professional diplomat of his generation in the United States.""<span> </span>Those who knew him said he remembered fondly his formative days at the University of Idaho.&nbsp;
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Our land-grant mission has global impact.<span> </span>American agriculture helps feed the world, and Idaho agriculture plays an increasing role with help from our College of Agricultural and Life Sciences.<span> </span>The College of Natural Resources, which emanated in part from the original College of Forestry, has revitalized some of the world's most barren places, while making productive land even more productive.<span> </span>Today, this work extends beyond U.S. borders to include regular overseas exchanges and permanent programs like <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/cogs/academics/costaricapartnership"">CATIE -- Centro Agronomico Tropical de Investigacion y Ensenanza or Tropical Agricultural Research and Higher Education Center </a>based in Costa Rica.<br>
                    <p>If homecoming is a time to celebrate achievements, it is also a time for fun.<span> </span>This year&rsquo;s homecoming promises plenty of that.<span> </span>Details are available <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/Homecoming"">here</a>.&nbsp;Life on campus has been accentuated by many contests and events this week, with the biggest events coming tonight &ndash; the Serpentine, led by The Sound of Idaho marching band, which concludes with the pep rally, bonfire, and fireworks &ndash; and tomorrow with the Homecoming Parade and the Homecoming football game.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
                    Leading this year&rsquo;s parade will be two remarkable Vandal couples &ndash; <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/newsevents/archive/alumni/jeffandkristinestoddard"">Jeff and Kris Stoddard</a> and <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/cbe/news-and-information/newindexpage/sharonallen"">Sharon and Rich Allen</a>. These dedicated Vandals have done many things for our university but most recently have led our <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/inspire"">Inspiring Futures Capital Campaign</a> to nearly $200 million in pursuit of our $225 million goal.<span> </span>We look forward to achieving and surpassing that goal, culminating the largest such effort in Idaho history.&nbsp;
                    <p>In 1932, the editors of The Gem, the Vandal yearbook, captured the continuing nature of our remarkable university. <br>

                    Idaho Geologic Map Honored for
                    Design, Quality Science. </strong>The comprehensive, rainbow-hued geologic map of
                    Idaho released in 2012 by the Idaho Geological Survey has received top
                    honors from the Association of American State Geologists. Its authors
                    won the inaugural Charles J. Mankin Memorial Award, which recognizes
                    state geological survey publications that stand out for their
                    uniqueness, design, high-quality science, and relevance to scientific
                    and societal issues. &ldquo;To be the first recipient of this award is
                    exciting,&rdquo; said Reed Lewis, an Idaho Geological Survey research
                    geologist who led the map project. &ldquo;These are our true peers who are
                    evaluating our work and recognizing it.&rdquo;<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/newsevents/item?name=idaho-geologic-map-honored-for-design-quality-science""><span> </span><strong>Read more.&nbsp;</strong></a>

                    <p><strong>Predator
                    Deprivation Study Earns National Award.</strong> A study performed by several
                    University of Idaho alumni on the response of mule deer to the reduction
                    of coyotes and mountain lions in Southeastern Idaho is receiving
                    national attention. Edward O. Garton, professor emeritus at the
                    University of Idaho College of Natural Resources, helped design the
                    study and analyze data that earned The Wildlife Society&rsquo;s 2013 Monograph
                    Award. The award will be given at the organization&rsquo;s annual conference
                    in October. One monograph is selected each year from a large field of
                    research. The study, funded primarily by Idaho Department of Fish and
                    Wildlife, began as a way of addressing the decline of mule deer in the
                    Northwest. <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/newsevents/item?name=ui-researchers-study-on-predator-deprivation-earns-national-award""><strong>Read more.&nbsp; </strong></a><strong></strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Daughter
                    Boosts Gordon Endowment, Doubles Student Scholarships.</strong> Joyce E. Gordon
                    recently doubled her contributions to the Glenn C. Gordon Scholarship
                    Endowment, established in honor of her father, Glenn C. Gordon &lsquo;41.
                    Last year, the endowment funded four scholarships for College of
                    Engineering students.<span>&nbsp; </span>Now with the endowment balance at
                    $500,000, the number of scholarships will double.&ldquo;This scholarship has
                    made all the difference in my college experience,&rdquo; said Ashley Vincent,
                    last year&rsquo;s scholarship recipient. &ldquo;Without financial aid, I wouldn&rsquo;t
                    have been able to put so much energy into academics. This scholarship
                    support has allowed me to choose extracurricular activities,
                    internships, and other incredible opportunities. I was able to accept my
                    selection into the Fulbright summer program, as well as a prestigious
                    internship in Washington, D.C.&rdquo; &ldquo;This major gift is transformative and
                    touches every corner of the College of Engineering,&nbsp;said Joe Law, Engineering Associate
                    Dean for Academics and Director of the Idaho Space Grant Consortium. ""It allows us to
                    promote excellence in our programs, recruit and retain the most
                    deserving and brightest students. An endowment gift is lasting and
                    provides support in perpetuity,&rdquo;&nbsp; For

Next year, in 2014, we will celebrate the 125th anniversary of Idaho&rsquo;s national land-grant, comprehensive, founding university. During that auspicious year we also expect our next long-term president to take office.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The presidential selection process is well underway. Just this week, our Board of Regents &ndash;- the State Board of Education &ndash; announced that the five finalists will visit Idaho in October, participating in statewide interviews that will enable them to meet students, faculty, staff, alumni, and civic leaders. The finalists were chosen from approximately 70 nominees and applicants by a hard working, 16-member search committee chaired by Regent Emma Atchley. [By agreement with the Board of Regents, your current interim president has not been a candidate.]<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The field of finalists is strong. Further information about them and the venues where you can meet them is <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/~/media/Files/administration/President/Presidential%20Search%202013/Finalist%20Press%20Release.ashx"" target=""_self"">available on our website.</a><br>
&nbsp;<br>
We have had 22 presidents to date, counting interim office holders. Indeed, our first president was an interim: Judge James H. Forney of Moscow. He played a key role in organizing the university and in recruiting our first long-term president, Franklin Benjamin Gault, whom he described as having &ldquo;a large jaw-bone shadowed by a proportionately large moustache.&rdquo; I later told [the] Regents that it would take a man with a large jaw-bone to run this thing because we had no money.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Jawboning remains an important part of the president &lsquo;s job today. The university president is an emissary -- an advocate for the distinctive history and mission of Idaho&rsquo;s first university. The president also is a member of the university faculty and staff, charged with shepherding our teaching, research and outreach functions and with advancing the interests of our students, the university community, and diverse stakeholders. The president, as both a leader and collaborator, is responsible for the university&rsquo;s fulfillment of responsibilities derived from our unique constitutional status as well as from an array of state and federal statutes.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Each of my predecessors has discharged these responsibilities diligently and has made an important contribution to our university&rsquo;s ongoing success. I hope and confidently anticipate that our next long-term president will bring to his or her work a studiously acquired understanding of Idaho, a heart-felt passion for the Vandal tradition, and a vision of the University of Idaho presidency as a capstone rather than a stepping stone.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
As shown in the table below, our presidents have come to us from a remarkable variety of disciplines. Their backgrounds reflect the breadth of our university&rsquo;s connections and responsibilities. Many presidents achieved distinction in their specialized fields before entering academic administration. President Frederick J. Kelly, to take just one example, earned national recognition as the creator of standardized tests of scholastic achievement.<br>

The president&rsquo;s job is one of daunting challenges but also of abundant joy.&nbsp; There is a special feeling about this place. Rafe Gibbs captured it in the title of his history of the University of Idaho:&nbsp; &ldquo;Beacon for Mountain and Plain.&rdquo;<br>

<strong>CALS Retiree Matches Idaho Cattle Foundation Gift To Establish Endowment.</strong> Carl Hunt, former chair of the Department of Animal and Veterinary Sciences, and his wife Martha established the Hunt Family Beef Education and Research Endowment with a commitment to match up to $50,000 in funds raised. Thanks to the recent $50,000 donation from the Idaho Cattle Foundation, Inc. &ndash;- created in 2009 by the Idaho Cattle Association &ndash;- the Hunts will be fulfilling their commitment. The Hunt Family Beef Education and Research Endowment was created to ensure a continued commitment to education and research concerning beef cattle at the University of Idaho. The funds will support student compensation for beef research, graduate assistantships, travel to conferences, supplies and equipment, and infrastructure improvements. The ultimate goal of the endowment is to invest $1 million for an endowed professorship within the department. The combined gifts of $100,000 from the Hunts and ICF provide an important first step toward reaching this goal. For more information on giving to the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences, contact Kim O&rsquo;Neill at (425) 359-2411 or&nbsp;<a href=""mailto:kimoneill@uidaho.edu"">kimoneill@uidaho.edu</a>&nbsp;or Jen Root at (208) 885-4087 or&nbsp;<a href=""mailto:jroot@uidaho.edu"">jroot@uidaho.edu</a>.<br>

Dear Friends,<br>
<br>
As readers of the Friday Letter know, the University of Idaho has a unique heritage.&nbsp; Established in 1889 it is our state&rsquo;s national land-grant, founding, comprehensive, and constitutionally recognized university.&nbsp;Those characteristics, taken together, classically define a flagship institution.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Flagships sail with a fleet. They receive their mission from a governing authority -- in our case, the Board of Regents -- and they fulfill that mission through collaboration with other members of the fleet, each of which has its own essential and vital capabilities. The fleet in Idaho higher education includes sister institutions with whom we share common bonds of history.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
For example, in 1901, the private Academy of Idaho became a state-run institution in Pocatello, one of the original sites proposed for the University of Idaho.&nbsp;The Academy of Idaho would become the Idaho Technical Institute in 1915, before being elevated to a new status as the University of Idaho &ndash; Southern Branch in 1927. For two decades, the University of Idaho delivered higher education in both Moscow and Pocatello, in addition to operating the University of Idaho&rsquo;s other statewide research and extension sites.&nbsp; In 1947, the Southern Branch became Idaho State College and later, in 1963, it became Idaho State University.&nbsp;I was living in Pocatello at the time.&nbsp;I remember how local pride swelled when ISC became ISU.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Today, the UI and ISU collaborate extensively.&nbsp;In Idaho Falls we deliver courses at the University Place facility, and our respective faculties conduct high-profile research at the Center for Advanced Energy Studies (CAES).&nbsp;We are joint participants in the Mountain West Regional Health Research Network, in National Science Foundation-supported watershed research; and in the Idea Network of Biomedical Research Excellence (INBRE). Just last month, UI and ISU faculty received national recognition for their award-winning Idaho Geological Survey (IGS) map<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Our sister institution 35 miles to the south, Lewis-Clark State College in Lewiston, also shares an historical narrative with the University of Idaho. Created by the Legislature in 1893, and starting operations in 1896 as Lewiston State Normal School, it had a mission of training teachers.&nbsp;It underwent several structural iterations before the Legislature closed it in 1951 to save money. Lobbying revived the school in 1955 as Lewis-Clark Normal School, organized as a branch of the University of Idaho, and was assigned the mission of preparing elementary school teachers.&nbsp;The chief executive officer of the school was a specially appointed dean from the University of Idaho.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
In 1963, the same year ISC became ISU, the Normal School received its current name, along with independent status and authority to offer a wider baccalaureate curriculum.&nbsp; Today, LCSC collaborates with the UI in several undergraduate programs including military science; and we are jointly planning, in cooperation with North Idaho College, a collaborative education facility in Coeur d&rsquo;Alene. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Our sister institution farther to the south, Boise State University, was established originally as Boise Junior College in 1932 by the Episcopal Church. Two years later the school became independent of the church and moved to its current location along the Boise River. In 1969 the school entered the state higher education system, gained four-year status, and was named Boise State College. In 1974 it achieved university status.&nbsp; During these transitions, BSU was not structurally linked to the UI, but sitting UI presidents occasionally joined the platform parties of graduation ceremonies in Boise.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Today, BSU collaborates with the UI through a host of faculty interactions including CAES and INBRE (mentioned above), through the joint offering of concurrent law-and-accounting degrees, and through a joint effort &ndash; coordinated the Small Business Development Center at BSU and the Small Business Legal Clinic at the UI &ndash; to provide statewide assistance to entrepreneurs seeking to get new enterprises off the ground. Just this week, the UI and BSU were both named by the Association of Public &amp; Land Grant Universities to a national list of only 16 &ldquo;Innovation and Economic Prosperity Universities.&rdquo;&nbsp;It is remarkable that sparsely populated Idaho captured two of those national designations.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
These successes show that collaboration is powerful.&nbsp;It is how the University of Idaho fulfills its distinctive calling. It is how we lead.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Go Vandals!<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Sincerely,<br>
<br>

<strong>UI Among Among 16 Most Economically Engaged, Innovative University. </strong>The Association of Public Land-grant Universities named the University of Idaho as one of the nation&rsquo;s top 16 &ldquo;Innovation and Economic Prosperity Universities.&rdquo; Formal recognition will be given in November at the annual APLU meeting. Notably, the original competitors formed a &ldquo;learning community&rdquo; to share strategies and methods before submitting their award applications.&nbsp; The winners were selected based on their assessment process, strategy, results, and plans for future economic development activities.&nbsp; Three other western schools were also recognized: California State &ndash; Fresno, Boise State, and Washington State.<br>

Scott Graduate Student Scholarship to support graduate students in Fish and Wildlife Sciences. &ldquo;We are honored that our retired faculty would choose to invest in our students and our programs so that we can continue to produce highly effective natural resource professionals,&rdquo; said Kurt Pregitzer, dean of the College of Natural Resources. Scott is a University Distinguished Professor Emeritus in the Department of Fish and Wildlife Sciences in the College of Natural Resources and his wife, Sharon, worked at the Martin Institute on campus for 20 years, until her retirement. Scott came to UI in 1986 with a background teaching and researching around the West and Hawaii. It was his work in Hawaii that led to the creation of the GAP Analysis Program that studies gaps in the protection of endangered and threatened plants and animals. The U.S. Geological Survey GAP Analysis is now used worldwide as a conservation standard.

Dear Friends,<br>
<br>
This has been a week of inspiration tinged with sadness.&nbsp;Last Saturday the Vandal family lost a gentle giant in our midst &ndash; the incomparable Malcolm M. Renfrew &ndash; who passed away in Moscow on the 103rd anniversary of his birth. We mourn the loss of this great and generous soul, while also celebrating his towering legacy. Perhaps you never met him, but he touched your life.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Like many Vandals, Dr. Renfrew -&ndash; known to his friends simply as Malcolm -- came from humble origins. Born in Spokane, he moved as a boy with his family to Potlatch, where he graduated from high school in 1928.&nbsp; He attended the University of Idaho during the early years of the Great Depression, earning bachelor&rsquo;s and master&rsquo;s degrees in chemistry, and meeting another student, Carol Campbell, with whom he was destined to share 71 years of married life.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
After completing a Ph.D. in chemistry at the University of Minnesota, he ventured from academia to industry, landing a research position at what is now the DuPont Corporation. There, he led teams that developed epoxy resins, created new materials for tooth repair, and synthesized a remarkable compound called polytetrafluoroethylene &ndash;- a durable, inert, and heat-resistant substance that proved useful to America&rsquo;s war effort.&nbsp;You may be more familiar with this product than you realize. In its patented commercial form, it became known as &hellip; Teflon.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<img align=""none"" height=""300"" src=""../images/Renfrew_Early.jpg"" style=""width: 217px;height: 300px;float: left;margin-right: 5px;display: block;border: none;"" width=""217""><br>
Malcolm later held research and management positions with other major industrial enterprises before returning to the University of Idaho, in 1959, to serve as head of the &ldquo;physical sciences&rdquo; department.&nbsp;In response to Malcolm&rsquo;s vision, the university established a separate and widely respected chemistry department, where Malcolm and his faculty colleagues expanded the scope of research and academic offerings.&nbsp;Malcolm played a prominent role in the design of a new laboratory and classroom building that now bears his name:&nbsp; Malcolm M. Renfrew Hall.&nbsp; He was nationally acclaimed for his innovative work, receiving the James Flack Norris Award for contributions to physical organic chemistry, and the American Chemical Society Global Salute to Polymers Award.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Malcolm retired in 1976, perhaps not anticipating that he had another 37 years of life ahead of him.&nbsp;During retirement he remained active in the sciences, volunteering as university patent director for ten years and serving as safety editor for the <em>Journal of Chemical Education</em>. He was a highly sought and graciously accessible mentor to a whole new generation of faculty and students.&nbsp; One colleague noted that Malcolm was &ldquo;a supporter of all things positive.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Malcolm also honed his artistic side -- creating watercolor paintings of Palouse area buildings and landscapes, and playing the trombone in local bands.&nbsp;Although it may be impossible to play trombone with a tongue in cheek, the bands went by such jocular names as the &ldquo;Idaho Vandals Non-Marching Pep Band&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Hog Heaven Big Band&rdquo; (&ldquo;Hog Heaven&rdquo; reputedly being an early nickname for the town of Moscow.).<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Throughout Malcolm&rsquo;s retirement years, he and his beloved Carol became popular fixtures at university events. They attended concerts, plays, lectures and athletic events.&nbsp; They even were named Homecoming Parade Grand Marshals and Moscow Renaissance Fair King and Queen.&nbsp; In mind and spirit, they were truly Renaissance people.&nbsp;They had no children, but they took the university community into their embrace.<br>
<img align=""none"" height=""300"" src=""../images/Renfrew_Late.jpg"" style=""width: 250px;height: 300px;float: right;margin-left: 5px;display: block;border: none;"" width=""250""><br>
A <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/class/mric"" target=""_self"">weekly interdisciplinary faculty colloquium</a> was named in their honor.&nbsp;A <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/inspire/ways/academics/science/priorities/faculty-fellowship-endowment"" target=""_self"">College of Science Faculty Fellowship Endowment</a>, which supports faculty members who excel at research and serve as mentors for their students, was also named for them. Malcolm and Carol contributed generously to student scholarships and to other endowments supporting departments and programs across the campus. When Carol passed away during <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/sci/newsevents/features/renfrew"" target=""_self"">Malcolm&rsquo;s 100th year</a> (her 96th), he endeavored for three more years to continue their tradition of active citizenship in the university.&nbsp;&ldquo;The last time I saw Malcolm in public,&rdquo; Interim Provost Katherine Aiken commented this week, &ldquo;he joined in the singing of the Alma Mater ... He was revered because he exemplified all that was best about academia in general and the University of Idaho specifically.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Great universities, like our own, attain their greatness through the unselfish work of exceptional people. We sustain that greatness, from generation to generation, by remembering those exceptional people and rededicating ourselves to the spirit of their work. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
So, with smiles and misty eyes &hellip; here&rsquo;s to you, Malcolm and Carol.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Go Vandals!<br>
<br>

<strong>U-Idaho Partners On $1.5 Million Doris Duke Conservation Scholars Grant.</strong> &nbsp;A $1.5 million Doris Duke Charitable Foundation grant will support University of Idaho students&rsquo; participation in the <a href=""http://programs.ifas.ufl.edu/ddcsp"" target=""_self"">Doris Duke Conservation Scholars Program</a>. The University of Florida, in partnership with University of Idaho and others, received the award. The program will provide undergraduate students who are interested in environmental issues and cultural diversity&nbsp;with training and mentored research activities in conservation biology and other disciplines relevant to land, water and wildlife conservation. Kerri Vierling, associate professor of fish and wildlife sciences, is leading the Idaho program, along with other College of Natural Resources faculty. &ldquo;Students will go out in the field, do fieldwork with grad students and faculty, and be immersed in science and natural resource research,&rdquo; Vierling said. &ldquo;At the end of their research experience, students will have conducted an independent research project and will present their findings to other students, faculty and groups such as K-12 students. Over the course of the multi-year experience, students will learn about science and about communicating science to a variety of audiences.&rdquo; The program will accept 25 students per year, five from each of the five partner universities.&nbsp; Initially two cohorts of students are planned, which will involve 50 students total. For more information about how your organization can partner with the university, contact Bobbi Hughes at (208) 885-5303 or <a href=""mailto:bhughes@uidaho.edu"">bhughes@uidaho.edu</a>.</td>

Dear Friends,<br>
<br>
How often have you heard universities described &ndash; with more derision than reverence &ndash; as &ldquo;ivory towers&rdquo; disconnected from the societies they serve?&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
It&rsquo;s a common perception, perhaps borne of the notion that academic excellence cannot be nurtured in close proximity to the &ldquo;real world.&rdquo;&nbsp;The truth, however, is quite the opposite. Excellence and real-world relevance go together.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
This connection is illustrated by the history of an extraordinary university &ndash; and, yes, of course, I refer to Idaho&rsquo;s national land-grant, founding, comprehensive, constitutionally recognized, flagship university!&nbsp;<br>

During the summer of 1947, the aptly named Charles William Hungerford, a professor in our College of Agriculture, traveled to Twin Falls and began to deliver an address titled &ldquo;What University Research Is Doing for the State of Idaho.&rdquo; He was briefly interrupted, however, according to Rafe Gibbs&rsquo; history, &ldquo;Beacon for Mountain and Plain.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&ldquo;We will be pleased to hear your speech, but you don&rsquo;t need to tell us what the University of Idaho is doing,&rdquo; said one of the farmers.<strong>&nbsp; &ldquo;If it weren&rsquo;t for the university we wouldn&rsquo;t be growing any beans.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;And it was true. Nearly all varieties of beans grown in the state had been developed and made available to farmers by the University of Idaho.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
In that same year, 1947, the university&rsquo;s relevance to Idaho was juxtaposed with a national accolade for excellence.&nbsp;Newsweek magazine published an article listing the American institutions that had produced the greatest number of Rhodes Scholars up to that time.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Princeton, Harvard, Yale, and Virginia occupied the top four slots on the list.&nbsp; Brown and Dartmouth tied for fifth place.&nbsp;And in sixth place, tied with the University of Michigan, was &hellip; the University of Idaho. &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<u>Our university had produced more Rhodes Scholars than any other institution of higher learning west of the Great Lakes.</u> Excellence and real-world relevance continue to characterize our university.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
As recently noted in the &ldquo;Friday Letter,&rdquo; our entering first-year undergraduate class this fall gave us a record enrollment of National Merit Scholars.&nbsp;At about the same time, our university was named by the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities as <a href=""http://www.aplu.org/page.aspx?pid=2680"" target=""_self"">one of the nation&rsquo;s top 16 institutions in promoting innovation and economic prosperity.</a><br>
&nbsp;<br>
The university&rsquo;s Entrepreneurial Task Force has developed a mission statement that expresses the spirit of relevance and excellence:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<em>The University of Idaho&#39;s <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/research/economic-development/aboutoed"" target=""_self"">mission in economic developmen</a>t is to collaborate in creating a vibrant and sustainable economy that improves quality of life and benefits Idaho, the region and beyond.&nbsp;We do this by mobilizing resources to advance innovation, help employers grow and prosper, strengthen communities and regional economies, and create an educated workforce.</em><br>
&nbsp;<br>
That mission translates into opportunities for our students, as well as faculty, to engage productively with businesses and governmental agencies. For example, the <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/engr/newsevents/features/capstone"" target=""_self"">College of Engineering&rsquo;s senior capstone design program has earned national recognition</a> for bringing students together with Boeing, Avista, Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories, and smaller businesses as well as government agencies such as NASA and multiple Idaho counties and municipalities, and mid-sized businesses.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
A case in point:&nbsp;At Buck Knives in Post Falls, our engineering students recently made a distinctive contribution. In the fall of 2012, a major piece of Buck&rsquo;s knife manufacturing equipment malfunctioned and had to be pulled off the line.<a href=""http://www.ktvb.com/news/business/UI-students-fix-Buck-Knives-machinery--205417311.html"" target=""_self""> Thanks to five Vandal mechanical engineering students the equipment now works and produces twice the number of knives</a>.&nbsp;The students gained workplace experience and mentoring, while Buck benefited from the students&rsquo; energy and inventiveness.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Faculty-student engagement in economic development is also exemplified by the&nbsp; <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/law/academics/clinicsprofessionalskills/clinics/smallbusinesslegalclinic"" target=""_self"">College of Law&rsquo;s small business legal clinic</a>. The clinic helps entrepreneurs get new enterprises off the ground, and it provides this service in collaboration with&nbsp; <a href=""http://www.idahosbdc.org/"" target=""_self"">Small Business Development Centers</a> operated by many of our sister institutions:&nbsp;Boise State University, Idaho State University, Lewis-Clark State College, and North Idaho College.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Working under faculty supervision, third-year law students help the entrepreneurs develop and implement the legal components of their business plans, including the choice of an appropriate form of business entity.&nbsp;The students contribute to economic development while acquiring insights and professional skills that will make them the enablers of their clients&rsquo; prosperity in the future.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
At the University of Idaho, our &ldquo;ivory tower&rdquo; soars academically, but its foundation is solidly based in service to Idaho and the nation.&nbsp;The &ldquo;real world&rdquo; is not foreign to us.&nbsp; After all, we helped invent it, and we continue to improve it every day.<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<span style=""color:#000000;"">Dear Friends,<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Readers of the Friday Letter are familiar with historian Rafe Gibbs&rsquo; stirring description of the University of Idaho as a &ldquo;beacon&rdquo; of excellence. In no endeavor does Idaho&rsquo;s light shine more brightly than in scientific discovery.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
That is one reason why our undergraduate student body contains 76 National Merit Scholars -&ndash; an extraordinary number -- including 25 first-year students.&nbsp;Of those new students, 22 have expressed their intention to pursue majors in the STEM (science-technology-engineering-math) disciplines.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<strong>The Right Place</strong><br>
<br>
These students have come to the right place. Here they will not only find excellence in the STEM disciplines, but also will gain a profound understanding of interdisciplinary connections to the social sciences and humanities.&nbsp; Idaho&rsquo;s national land-grant, comprehensive, founding university will prepare them for careers in discovery, enabling them to become innovators who drive economic development and social progress. We have a history of doing so.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
For example, Arthur Adair from Moscow, UI Class of 1896, took his Idaho education eastward and became the chief engineer of the Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation.&nbsp;Thomas Galloway, from Weiser, UI Class of 1907, became a medical researcher and educator who developed surgical techniques to save polio patients. Joseph Braham, of Moscow, UI Class of 1914, went on to lead research and development for Allied Chemical and Dye Corporation -- today known simply as Allied.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
More recently, </span><strong><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/engr/our-people/academyofengineers/2011-class/lemley"" target=""_self""><span style=""color:#0000ff;"">Jack Lemley, UI Class of 1960</span></a></strong><span style=""color:#0000ff;"">,</span><span style=""color:#000000;""> became chief executive of the British-French consortium that constructed the &ldquo;chunnel&rdquo; beneath the English Channel -&ndash; the largest privately funded construction project in history.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<strong>Global &amp; Extra-Global Impact</strong><br>
<br>
Today, even as this Friday Letter is written, scientists worldwide are studying data and images transmitted from the </span><strong><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/newsevents/item?name=ui-researchers-help-decode-new-view-of-saturns-moon-titan-contribute-to-cassini-mission"" target=""_self""><span style=""color:#0000ff;"">Cassini spacecraft orbiting Saturn</span></a></strong><span style=""color:#0000ff;"">,</span><span style=""color:#000000;""> and from</span><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/engr/newsevents/features/curiosity"" target=""_self""><span style=""color:#000000;""> </span><span style=""color:#0000ff;""><strong>the Mars Curiosity Explorer traversing the Martian surface.</strong> </span></a><span style=""color:#000000;"">Both spacecraft contain vital components developed by teams of scientists at the University of Idaho.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
At our College of Natural Resources, researchers have developed a technique for tracking movements and migrations of fish and mammals, using environmental DNA (eDNA) collected from the cells that animals shed into the environment.&nbsp;</span><strong><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/cnr/fishwild/lisettewaits"" target=""_self""><span style=""color:#0000ff;"">Lisette Waits</span></a></strong><span style=""color:#000000;"">, professor of fish and wildlife sciences, and her colleagues have pioneered and expanded the eDNA technique, opening doors to many research possibilities and applications such as </span><strong><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/cnr/newsevents/featurestories/stemming-the-stream-of-snails"" target=""_self""><span style=""color:#0000ff;"">combating invasive species that threaten to destroy waterways</span></a></strong><span style=""color:#000000;"">.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
In our College of Agricultural &amp; Life Sciences, researchers at the </span><strong><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/aquaculture/"" target=""_self""><span style=""color:#0000ff;"">UI Aquaculture Research Institute in Hagerman, Idaho</span></a></strong><span style=""color:#000000;"">, are developing plant protein foods to feed trout. This could end the unsustainable practice of feeding commercial freshwater fish with food made from ocean fish. If successful, Idaho &ndash;- the world&rsquo;s largest producer of commercial trout &ndash;- will benefit, as will the world&rsquo;s population.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
These are but a few illustrations of the impact of discovery and innovation at the University of Idaho. Additional examples can be found in student work displayed in the</span><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/research/innovation-showcase/2013-award-winners"" target=""_self""><span style=""color:#000000;""> </span><span style=""color:#0000ff;""><strong>university&rsquo;s latest Innovation Showcase</strong></span></a><span style=""color:#000000;"">, in the </span><strong><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/engr/expo/designprojects"" target=""_self""><span style=""color:#0000ff;"">College of Engineering&rsquo;s Senior Design Projects</span></a></strong><span style=""color:#000000;"">, and in the </span><strong><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/cbe/experientiallearning/view/businessplan/2013-business-plan-competition-winners"" target=""_self""><span style=""color:#0000ff;"">College of Business &amp; Economics&rsquo; Vandal Innovation and Enterprise Works competition</span></a></strong><span style=""color:#000000;"">.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&ldquo;Making the world a better place&rdquo; may be an over-used phrase; but when applied to the University of Idaho, it is a noble and authentic expression. We embrace it.<br>
Our students are embarked upon the open sea of discovery and innovation. Their destination is a better world of their own making. The University of Idaho&rsquo;s beacon will guide them, and the flagship will carry them to shore.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><br>

<br>
<span style=""color:#000000;"">Dear Friends,<br>
&nbsp;<br>
In 1863, at the first session of the Idaho Territorial Legislature, William B. Daniels, Secretary of the Territory and Acting Governor, issued a clarion call for public support of education:<br>
&nbsp;</span>
<div dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align: justify;"">
	<span style=""color:#000000;""><em>&quot;It cannot be necessary to argue the necessity of education to the preservation of our free institutions&hellip;.Prosperity, wealth, luxury, vice and ruin, are the successive steps in the career of every nation that does not rely upon the virtue and intelligence of the people. &nbsp;All the gold in these mountains will not save us from the fate of free nations that have gone before us if we do not educate our children, but rather make our decline more swift and sure&hellip;.Let us establish schools and churches, encourage teachers, patronize the arts and sciences &hellip; and labor to perpetuate our institutions by a unison of intelligence and virtue, liberty and law&hellip;.&rdquo;</em></span></div>
<span style=""color:#000000;"">&nbsp;<br>
In 1933, exactly seven decades after Governor Daniels spoke, my parents graduated from high school in the mining town of Wallace, and enrolled at the University of Idaho. Their Wallace education had prepared them well: they succeeded in their studies at the university and became the first members of their families to earn college degrees.&nbsp; For them, education opened a gateway of opportunity. Their success was a testament to Governor Daniels&rsquo; vision for Idaho.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Fast forward another eight decades. Today, we at Idaho&rsquo;s founding, comprehensive, land-grant university remain focused on student success. The stakes are high. Careers awaiting our students are being shaped by a rapidly changing, globally competitive economy. Nearly two-thirds of the new jobs created in America by the year 2020 will require at least some level of post-secondary education, yet just over one-third of Idahoans have attained that level.<br>
<br>
<strong>Closing The Gap</strong><br>
&nbsp;<br>
Closing this gap will be a daunting challenge. Regrettably, we have observed that many students are not fully prepared to succeed in college, which means they may not reach the gateway of opportunity my parents enjoyed. The problem is statewide. Nearly one-fourth of Idaho students attending our four-year institutions require remedial math and/or English classes. (The ratio at the University of Idaho is lower than the statewide average; but even at our university, remedial classes are offered in English.) At Idaho&rsquo;s two-year institutions, roughly three-fourths of students need remedial classes.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
When students must take remedial courses, the pathway to a degree becomes longer and more expensive. Universities must allocate resources to such instruction, to the detriment of the rest of the curriculum. Moreover, if students with remedial needs do not succeed in traveling the entire post-secondary education pathway, employers may find themselves picking up the slack because core math and language skills are essential in the workplace. Employers need employees who are capable of problem-solving and critical thinking, written and oral communication, and an understanding of applied mathematics, in order to perform the jobs of the 21st century.<br>
<br>
<strong>Success Starts Early</strong><br>
&nbsp;<br>
Success in college starts before college. That&rsquo;s why, in the spring of this year, our then-president Duane Nellis joined all other presidents of Idaho&rsquo;s four-year institutions in urging support for implementation of the &ldquo;Idaho Common Core Standards,&rdquo; developed to enhance the rigor and quality of student learning in Idaho&rsquo;s public schools. The presidents&rsquo; letter can be accessed <a href=""http://www.sde.idaho.gov/site/common/docs/IdahoCoreStandards%20letter%20from%20presidents%202013_Vailas.pdf"" target=""_self"">here</a>.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The &ldquo;Idaho Common Core Standards&rdquo; have been developed in Idaho for Idaho; their content is not federally prescribed. Indeed, 45 other states have developed their own common cores, each state striving to address its own educational and workforce needs.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The term &ldquo;common core&rdquo; has become politically charged in some circles. After all, Americans &ndash;- especially Idahoans -- are independent thinkers. The strength of the American republic derives from the authority and creativity of the states.&nbsp; Accordingly, each state can establish its own core standards and adjust them from time to time. But the future will not wait. It is important to act upon the wide consensus that students need to arrive at post-secondary institutions ready to do post-secondary work.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
As readers of the Friday Letter know, there is an inscription at the entry of our historic Administration Building, proclaiming that the University of Idaho&rsquo;s mission is to educate Idahoans &ldquo;to their highest usefulness in private life and public service.&rdquo; In order for us to fulfill that mission, we need all parts of the Idaho educational continuum to be strong.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Here&rsquo;s to Idaho as a place of opportunity. And &hellip; go Vandals!<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Sincerely,<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<span style=""color:#000000;"">Dear Friends,<br>
&nbsp;<br>
It takes a special kind of person to be a good doctor: someone who combines intellect with compassion. The <a href=""https://www.aamc.org/students/aspiring/basics/280558/right-career.html"" target=""_self"">Association of American Medical Colleges </a>asks aspiring doctors not only whether they are interested in science but also whether they are good listeners who care deeply about other people, their problems, and their pain. Those who can truthfully say yes will have a future in the healing profession.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Perhaps no field of medicine demands a stronger alliance of the mind and heart than primary care. Pediatricians, family practitioners, and general internists, for example, treat a wide range of illnesses and regularly provide preventive care.&nbsp; They enjoy long-term relationships with their patients and their communities. They usually earn less than surgeons and specialists, and their work bears little resemblance to a 9-to-5 job; but they are often described as heroes by their patients. Their service is noble and needed.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Idaho has faced a shortage of doctors for years, averaging 49th in the nation &ndash; and lowest among the western states -- for doctor availability. As of 2012, only five Idaho counties had an adequate number of doctors, according to federal guidelines. That shortage will worsen as doctors reach retirement in the coming decade. The American Medical Association estimates that approximately 42% of all physicians in Idaho are 55 years of age or older.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The problem is especially acute in the primary care field, where the costs of medical education collide with comparatively modest earnings. Fortunately, Idaho is responding. With support from our Board of Regents (the State Board of Education), the Governor&rsquo;s Office, and the Legislature, our state is expanding its participation in <strong><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/academics/wwami"" target=""_self"">WWAMI</a></strong> -- a remarkably cost-effective and efficient medical education partnership in which the states of Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho collaborate with each other and with the University of Washington School of Medicine. The program underwrites a portion of the students&rsquo; educational expenses, so they can afford to practice where they are most needed and their hearts take them.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
For nearly 40 years, this program has trained 20 Idaho students per year, along with the students from other participating states, with a special emphasis on preparing the graduates to practice primary care medicine in rural and other under-served areas. This year the Idaho number grew to 25 students and, given the expressed interest of state leaders, we expect it to grow to 40 students annually by academic year 2017.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
This growing program benefits Idaho in many ways:</span><br>
<ul>
	<li>
		<span style=""color:#000000;"">We have a greater rate of return of our students than the national average of medical education programs &ndash;- more than 70 percent counting WWAMI students from other states who eventually choose to locate their practices in Idaho.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>
		<span style=""color:#000000;"">These students are among the best educated in the country. UW&rsquo;s primary care program has been ranked at or near the top nationally throughout the past two decades. The WWAMI model delivers such high-quality and cost-effective instruction that it is attracting international attention as a possible model for transnational medical education.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>
		<span style=""color:#000000;"">The program generates research as well as instruction; indeed, the biomedical research productivity of the Idaho WWAMI faculty exceeds that of many faculty at conventional bricks-and-mortar medical schools. The research draws upon, and reinforces, our nationally known programs in biological sciences and bioinformatics.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>
		<span style=""color:#000000;"">Through the combination of instruction and research, the Idaho WWAMI program pumps five dollars into the Idaho economy for every dollar invested by Idaho taxpayers &ndash;- more than twice the average national rate of return.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style=""color:#000000;"">Currently, the <strong><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/academics/wwami"" target=""_self"">Idaho WWAMI program</a></strong> consists of the first-year experience in Moscow (slated to expand to 18 months under a contemplated curricular change), followed by study at the UW in Seattle, and then by clinical rotations in which the students can stay in Idaho or gain experience elsewhere within the five-state region. The program is evolving to offer almost all of the four years within Idaho, if a student so chooses. Moreover, beyond the M.D. degree, there are WWAMI-affiliated residency programs in our state to complete a physician&rsquo;s training and to solidify further his or her likelihood of practicing in our state.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Many WWAMI graduates are serving in rural areas of Idaho, providing quality medical care in places ranging from St. Maries to McCall to Montpelier, where access to care would otherwise be absent or attenuated. Over the history of the WWAMI program, nearly 500 WWAMI graduates have entered practice in Idaho.&nbsp; Many of them undoubtedly are caring for readers of this Friday Letter.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
WWAMI provides the best of both worlds for Idaho and Idaho&rsquo;s students: it enables new members of the healing profession to take their skills and their ideals into communities where they are needed most. The program is one more example of how the University of Idaho &ndash;- yes, Idaho&rsquo;s national land-grant, founding, comprehensive, constitutional university! &ndash;- strengthens our lives and our livelihoods.<br>

<span style=""color:#000000;"">Dear Friends,<br>
<br>
This has been a week of contrasts:&nbsp; solemn remembrance and hopeful anticipation. The remembrance -- for those old enough to recall November 22, 1963 -- is of the exact place where each of us heard the dreadful news from Dallas. The news reached me during lunch hour at Pocatello High School, where I was a student. In the days of mourning that followed in the nation&rsquo;s capital, journalist Mary McGrory reportedly said to Assistant Secretary of Labor Pat Moynihan, &quot;We&#39;ll never laugh again.&quot; Moynihan, who later became a U.S. senator, replied, &quot;Mary, we&#39;ll laugh again, but we&#39;ll never be young again.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
And yet &hellip; at the John F. Kennedy Memorial at Arlington National Cemetery, an eternal flame reminds visitors of a young president&rsquo;s enduring spirit. Inscribed at the memorial are words from the president&rsquo;s inaugural address:</span><br>
<br>
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
	<span style=""color:#000000;"">Let the word go forth<br>
	From this time and place<br>
	To friend and foe alike<br>
	That the torch has been passed<br>
	To a new generation of Americans.<br>
	We carry on.</span></div>
<span style=""color:#000000;"">&nbsp;<br>
For members of the University of Idaho community, a happier page of history was turned this week. <span style=""color:#000000;""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/newsevents/presidential-announcement"" target=""_self"">The Board of Regents (State Board of Education) announced the appointment of Dr. Charles (&ldquo;Chuck&rdquo;) Staben, Ph.D.</a></span> as our next university president, effective March 1, 2014. When President Staben&rsquo;s administration begins, the university will be celebrating its 125th year of leadership in Idaho higher education. With hopeful anticipation of an ever-brightening future, my wife Karen and I warmly welcome Chuck and his spouse, Dr. Mary Beth Staben, M.D., to the Vandal family.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
This is not the first time an interim president, with a background in law and the judiciary, has been accorded the honor of welcoming an incoming president. In 1892, the university&rsquo;s first &ndash;- and first interim -- president, Judge James H. Forney, welcomed Franklin R. Gault as the inaugural permanent president of Idaho&rsquo;s founding university. President Gault brought to his work a background in mathematics and school administration. In 2014, President-designate Staben will come to us from the University of South Dakota, and previously the University of Kentucky, with a professor&rsquo;s record of achievement in science and a provost&rsquo;s record of success in university administration. His glowing curriculum vita can be <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/~/media/Files/administration/President/Presidential%20Search%202013/Finalists/Chuck-Staben.ashx"" target=""_self"">accessed here</a>.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
There is another noteworthy parallel. After a serving with distinction as the President of the University of Idaho, Dr. Gault went on to become president of &hellip; the University of South Dakota. Dr. Staben is now returning the favor by coming from South Dakota to Idaho, and is doing so with great enthusiasm. &ldquo;I love what the University of Idaho has to offer,&rdquo; he told a university audience this week. &ldquo;I love the mountains; I love the West; I feel like this is home.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I urge all Vandals &ndash;- indeed, all friends of higher education &ndash;- to join in extending a warm, Idaho-style &ldquo;welcome to your new home&rdquo; greeting to our newest family members: Chuck and Mary Beth Staben. They will enhance our legacy of leading. </span><br>
<span style=""color:#000000;"">&nbsp;<br>
Sincerely,<br>
<br>

<br>
<span style=""color:#000000;"">Dear Friends,<br>
&nbsp;<br>
During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the concept of &ldquo;place&rdquo; became a focus of scholarship and public discourse on issues of social progress, human development, and education. The famous landscape architect, Frederick Law Olmsted, who designed Central Park in New York City, and whose family colleagues designed much of the University of Idaho campus in Moscow, believed that well-designed spaces could promote a sense of community, harmony, and balance in which individual minds and hearts would flourish.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Today, as visitors stroll across our picturesque Moscow campus, they sense what Olmsted intended. The gently rolling land, the forests, the clearings, and the vistas combine to inspire thoughtfulness and reflection. Interspersed among these natural features are iconic structures such as the Administration Building and Memorial Gym, giving the campus a distinct visual identity. In refreshing contrast to the modern era of standardized, utilitarian design &ndash;- what author James Howard Kuntsler has called the &ldquo;geography of nowhere&rdquo; -&ndash; the University of Idaho has retained a unique sense of place. Here, you know where you are, and you feel that you belong.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
This is, of course, also a place of academic purpose. When you enter one of our academic buildings, you step from an external space of tranquility into an internal space of activity. The internal space is, and must be, designed to stimulate bright minds and to enable the high levels of teaching, learning, discovery, and creativity that are the signatures of a great university. Such space requires an ongoing investment in facilities -&ndash; not in buildings as ends in themselves, but rather in spaces than enliven the spirit of academic endeavor.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The connection between facilities and the spirit of the university was underscored by UI President M. G. Neale, who served from 1930 to 1937. Returning to campus as a visitor in 1961, he commented:</span><br>
<br>
<span style=""color:#000000;""><em>&quot;The facilities at the University of Idaho have come a long way since my time.&nbsp; But they are not the most significant factor. It&rsquo;s the tone &ndash;- the high academic tone that has made the University of Idaho a superior institution. It was here when I came, and it&rsquo;s still here today. [Former presidents] Gault and Maclean established that tone. The beginning of an institution is so important to it. Too much credit cannot be given to those early presidents, who left to Idaho a most precious history.&quot;</em><br>
&nbsp;<br>
In recent years, resources for investment have been severely constrained; but we are making the most of what we have. This past summer, for example, we renovated -&ndash; and upgraded the technology in -- several major classrooms familiar to our alumni. The projects included classrooms of the Renfrew Building, home of the Department of Chemistry, which had not been updated since the building&rsquo;s original construction in the 1960s. The projects also included a major general-purpose classroom in the Teaching and Learning Center adjacent to the Idaho Commons. These upgrades represented the first iteration of a multi-year effort to improve the environments in our large-capacity classrooms on the Moscow campus.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The second iteration, currently in the design phase, will include another venue familiar to UI graduates: the 400-seat classroom in the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences (Ag Sci 106).This heavily used facility has not seen significant reinvestment since its original construction in 1951. Future projects are also expected to include upgrades in the Life Sciences South (LSS) Building and the Janssen Engineering (JEB) Building, as well as the historic Administration Building Auditorium. Each of these facilities is located on the Moscow campus, but facilities at our other statewide locations will be included in future plans as well.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
In addition to the renovation of existing buildings in Moscow, we are at the cusp of making a major investment in our first new academic building in more than a decade: <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/inspire/ways/iric"" target=""_self"">the Integrated Research and Innovation Center</a>. Plans call for a technologically advanced building that will house interdisciplinary teams of researchers engaged in problem-solving on issues facing our state and nation. &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
What is important about these structures, as President Neale said, is the work that goes on within them. When you open doors of academic buildings at the University of Idaho, you can almost hear the hum of activity in world-class programs like the <a href=""http://inbre.uidaho.edu/about/"" target=""_self"">IDeA Network of Biomedical Research Excellence</a>, the NASA Idaho Space Grant Consortium, <a href=""http://www.ibest.uidaho.edu/"" target=""_self"">the Institute for Bioinformatics and Evolutionary Studies</a>, <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/cbe/barker-program"" target=""_self"">the Barker Capital Management and Trading Program</a>, and <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/jazzfest"" target=""_self"">the Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival</a>.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Such exceptional programs, and the facilities to house them, require not only public investment but also the margin of excellence provided by private support.&nbsp; The University of Idaho&rsquo;s capital campaign, launched with a goal of $225 million (more than any other Idaho institution has yet attempted to raise), has just crossed the $200 million mark. To all who have contributed, and to all who are planning to contribute, in whatever amount, we extend our heartfelt thanks.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The University of Idaho is a place of visual beauty and inspiring achievement. It is a place where hearts are fulfilled and minds grow. It is our place. Wherever we live, a part of us resides here.&nbsp;</span><br>

<span style=""color:#000000;""><strong>Ahlskog&rsquo;s Affinity To University Of Idaho Grows Over Time. </strong>Since earning his bachelor&rsquo;s degree in history, Howard Ahlskog &rsquo;68 has supported the University of Idaho through joining <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/advancement/departments/donor-relations/donor-rolls/heritage-society"" target=""_self"">the Heritage Society</a> and through his annual contributions supporting the Vandal Scholarship Fund. &ldquo;I support the Vandal Scholarship Fund, and I think it&rsquo;s very important for the athletics program to be competitive in all sports and not just football and basketball,&rdquo; said Ahlskog. &ldquo;Winning programs help attract quality students who, in turn, will excel not only in athletics but academically.&rdquo; His loyal support totals 22 years of giving to the University of Idaho, including pledges he&rsquo;s made through the Vandal Connect Call Center. &ldquo;I really enjoy visiting with student callers and look forward to their phone call each year,&rdquo; said Ahlskog. &ldquo;My conversation with them helps to connect me back to the campus that I have grown to love more and more as the years go by.&rdquo; A native of the West, this East Coast transplant continues to follow happenings at the University through mailings, emails and other University communications.

<span style=""font-size:14px;""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Dear Friends,</span><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">&ldquo;Like all organizations and individuals, a university must be judged by what it does, not by what it says.&rdquo; This cautionary note, sounded by one of our university&rsquo;s most distinguished leaders, Donald R. Theophilus (president, 1954-65), resonates today as a call to action.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
We are heeding the call. As we approach our 125th anniversary, we have positioned the University of Idaho at the intersection of thought and action. Our scholars are producing new understandings of the solar system through their collaborative work on the </span><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/engr/newsevents/features/curiosity"" target=""_self""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 205);"">Curiosity Rover mission </span></a><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">to Mars and the</span><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 205);""> </span><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/newsevents/item?name=ui-researchers-help-decode-new-view-of-saturns-moon-titan-contribute-to-cassini-mission"" target=""_self""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 205);"">Huygens-Cassini mission</span></a><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""> to Saturn. Here on Earth, we are helping to secure the world&rsquo;s food supply through scientific research on climate change and its impacts upon agricultural productivity. Looking deeply into &ldquo;inner space,&rdquo; our faculty and students are developing molecular structures for resilient new materials, and are discovering the intra-cell secrets of human and animal disease.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
We can generate such knowledge across a broad range of disciplines, transmit it through engaged teaching, and put it to work for the benefit of humanity, only if we attract talented people and furnish them the resources they need for high-quality work. As Dr. Theophilus observed:<br>
&nbsp;</span></span>

<div style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size:14px;""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""><em>&quot;The record of the University of Idaho, with all its accomplishments, has been made by thousands of individuals; and, accordingly, future achievements of the University will belong to those who make them possible. To accomplish its mission in the world&rsquo;s new frontiers, the University needs competent personnel, properly prepared and motivated students, and tools of knowledge in the form of adequate facilities and satisfactory equipment.</em>&quot;</span></span></div>
<span style=""font-size:14px;""> <span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">&nbsp;<br>
This requires a marriage of public support and private investment. Public support is vital for acquiring physical infrastructure and achieving institutional competence, while private investment is essential to attaining the margin of excellence.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Two salient examples are the proposed Integrated Research Innovation Center (IRIC) and the planned renovation of the College of Education building on our Moscow campus. As noted in last week&rsquo;s &ldquo;Friday Letter,&rdquo; </span><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/inspire/ways/iric"" target=""_self""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 205);"">the IRIC</span></a><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""> will contain advanced laboratories and equipment for collaborative, interdisciplinary research. With a combination of public support from the Idaho Permanent Building Fund, university bonding supported by research grant revenues, and private contributions, we will have one of the most forward-looking research facilities in the nation.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The College of Education </span><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/inspire/ways/academics/college-of-education/about-the-college/stories/education-renovation-building-project"" target=""_self""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 205);"">renovation project</span></a><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 205);""> </span><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">will enable the university, not only to replace a deteriorating structure with a state-of-the-art teaching and learning facility, but also to re-envision how tomorrow&rsquo;s teachers and school administrators should be educated and professionally developed. The renovated building, and the programs it houses, will enable the University of Idaho to be a leader in restoring America&rsquo;s global preeminence in the quality of K-12 education. Sources of support for this endeavor will include the Idaho Permanent Building Fund, university bonding, foundation grants, and private contributions.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
New and improved facilities comprise one of the four cornerstones of the university&rsquo;s $225 million<a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/inspire"" target=""_self""> </a></span><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/inspire"" target=""_self""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 205);"">&ldquo;Inspiring Futures&rdquo; capital campaign</span></a><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 205);"">.</span><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""> The other cornerstones are financial aid to students, development and sustainment of forward-looking academic programs, and support for faculty excellence.&nbsp; Readers of the &ldquo;Friday Letter&rdquo; know that we have already crossed the $200 million mark in this ambitious effort.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The generosity of our alumni and friends is impressive, and the sheer number of contributors is heartwarming. Last month, we received our 100,000<sup>th</sup> campaign contribution. It came from a 1985 alumnus who has joined nearly 44,000 other donors in supporting the noble cause of &ldquo;inspiring futures.&rdquo; </span><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/inspire/stories"" target=""_self""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 205);"">The donors themselv</span></a><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/inspire/stories""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 205);"">es are inspiring.</span></a><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""> We humbly thank them all for enabling our beloved university to be judged highly on what we do, not merely on what we say.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Somewhere, President Theophilus must be smiling.</span><br>

<span style=""color:#000000;"">Dear Friends,</span><br>
<span style=""color:#000000;"">&nbsp;<br>
I was born on third base. &nbsp;Please let me explain.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
If life were analogized to baseball, we might characterize a career as &ldquo;circling the bases&rdquo; in an effort to reach &ldquo;home&rdquo; successfully. I make no claim of success in my own career, but I do know that I have enjoyed a huge head start on the bases. I was nurtured and guided by parents who were college graduates and role models for the value of education. &nbsp;They came to the University of Idaho, during the Depression years, children of mining families in which no one ever had attended a university. They started their lives at home plate. They enabled me to start on third base.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
First-generation college students like my parents have always embodied the American dream. Their upward mobility has helped shape a society defined by opportunity rather than by status. Moreover, first-generation students, on average, enhance the socioeconomic, demographic, and geographic diversity of higher education. Because students learn from each other, as well as from our faculty, diversity of backgrounds and perspectives enriches the educational experience for all students.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Enrollment of first-generation students is important for economic development reasons as well. The Idaho State Board of Education, after reviewing studies conducted by Georgetown University and the Lumina Foundation, has determined that approximately two-thirds of jobs expected to become available in Idaho by the year 2020 will require at least some post-secondary education (and about half of those will require a baccalaureate or advanced degree). Yet just over one-third of Idahoans have attained this educational level.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Consequently, Idaho has a work force imbalance: an oversupply of workers with education levels of high school or less, and an undersupply of workers with post-secondary education. An oversupply at the low end depresses wages and attracts businesses paying minimum wages. An undersupply at the high end discourages businesses that pay higher compensation and contemplate locating or expanding in our state.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
For all these reasons &ndash;- upward mobility, diversity, and economic development -- the University of Idaho actively recruits first-generation students. At the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, many first-generation students &ndash;- women as well as men -&ndash; found the doors of higher education opened to them by military training programs (precursors to our present ROTC programs). Today, one of our most visible recruiting efforts is the <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/ed/trio/stemaccess/upward-bound-math-science"" target=""_self"">STEM Access Upward Bound program</a>, designed to attract low-income and first-generation college-bound teenagers who have exhibited an interest in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/ed/trio/bridge-idaho"" target=""_self"">Our Bridge Idaho program </a>provides further support for these and other first-generation students when they come to our Moscow campus.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
First-generation students as a group are cost-conscious. Consequently, the affordability of a University of Idaho degree and the availability of University-based financial aid are important factors in decisions by these students and their families on whether to commit to college in Moscow. We are grateful to donors who have established scholarship funds to help the University secure this commitment.<br>
<br>
Our efforts are producing results. The University&rsquo;s enrollment management office has reported that first-generation students comprised about 35% of our most recent entering undergraduate class &ndash;- a figure that compares favorably to a nationwide average of about 30%. Our aim is to establish Idaho as a place of opportunity for all &ndash;- especially those whose lives begin at home plate!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style=""color:#000000;"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

Dear Friends,<br>
<br>
I hope this first “Friday Letter” of 2014 finds you enjoying a happy new year. At the University of Idaho, this new year will bring a celebration of our 125th anniversary as Idaho’s founding, land-grant, comprehensive institution.&nbsp; It will also bring –- as every year does -– a reminder of a perennial challenge:&nbsp; pursuing excellence with constrained public resources. In 1954, one of the University of Idaho’s finest presidents, Dr. Donald R. Theophilus, wrote to the faculty:<br>
<br>
<em>This afternoon I leave for Boise for a review of our budget needs…. Our requests are based on a level of expenditure that will assure appropriate standards and quality of instruction and research controlled by judicious management. The anticipated operations are, we believe, within the means provided by the wealth and income of Idaho to support. Our job in making an adequate and convincing presentation to the Legislature of the University’s needs will be materially supported and aided by a high level of job performance on your part</em> [the faculty].<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Six decades later, the “job performance” of our faculty has made the University worthy of its flagship heritage, of continued public confidence, and of elevated public investment. I am pleased to report that Idaho Governor C.L. “Butch” Otter has made education the principal theme of his 2014 State of the State address, and he has released budget recommendations to the Legislature that would underwrite substantial improvements in support for education at all levels in Fiscal Year 2015.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
With respect to post-secondary education, the Governor has emphasized the synergy between education and economic development, recommending investments in higher education and professional-technical programs that are “measured, manageable and within our means.” His recommendations include:
<ul>
    <li>Additional funding for high-demand academic programs at each of Idaho’s four-year colleges and universities, in support of the State Board’s “Complete College Idaho” initiative. This would bring approximately $1.05 million to the University of Idaho for more instructional capacity.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>An increase of $1.5 million for our university’s Agricultural Research and Extension Service, which has contributed significantly to the success of Idaho agriculture. Idaho’s agricultural earnings have doubled in value over the past 15 years, making agriculture as the largest single sector of the state’s economy. Farm revenues have increased for three successive years, enabling Idaho to become the third largest agriculture state in the West, following California and nearly equaling Washington.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Increasing by $1 million the State of Idaho’s investment in the Center for Advanced Energy Studies in Idaho Falls. This center –- a collaborative undertaking of faculty at the University of Idaho, Idaho State University, and Boise State University, in cooperation with the Idaho National Laboratory -– has produced breakthrough, high-tech research with a high multiplier effect upon economic development.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Adding $400,000 to our legal education program in Boise, giving students an opportunity to take second-year courses along with the existing third-year curriculum in the state capital. This curricular enhancement, authorized by the State Board, would enable students in our Juris Doctor program (which entails three years of graduate-level study), to pursue upper-level specialties in Moscow and Boise based on the comparative advantages each location offers. In Moscow, these advantages include natural resources and environmental law, Native American and tribal law, and dispute resolution.&nbsp; In Boise the advantages include business law, economic development, and certain forms of regulatory law. The overall program design embodies a “Moscow plus Boise” approach, utilizing complementary locations that maximize student opportunities and fulfill our university’s statewide mission.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Increasing by approximately $1.1 million the funding available for the employer’s share of the rising costs of health insurance provided to University of Idaho faculty and staff.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Investing approximately $252,000 in the second cohort of students filling last year’s five-seat enrollment expansion in our WWAMI (Washington-Wyoming-Alaska-Montana-Idaho) medical education program. This program enables Doctor of Medicine (MD) students to begin their studies in Idaho, take advanced classes at the acclaimed University of Washington Medical School, and participate in clinical experiences throughout the WWAMI area. Students receive a lower-cost medical education and graduate with less debt than they would incur in conventional medical education programs, thereby making it feasible for them to devote their careers to lower-paying specialties and under-served communities.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Providing approximately $2.4 million as an inflationary adjustment to funding for scientific equipment, information technology, media devices, etc., at the University of Idaho. This is the first time in recent years that such an adjustment has been recommended.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Setting aside $29 million in the Public Education Stabilization Fund, and $7 million in a recently created Higher Education Stabilization Fund. This would improve higher education planning and administration by minimizing the need for disruptive holdbacks during budget periods if and when state revenues fall short of projections.</li>
</ul>
The university is grateful for the Governor’s recommendations. Needless to say, we did not receive everything we requested. The recommendations do not include a requested additional five-seat expansion of the WWAMI program, support for certain wildlife and geological survey faculty, or –- most notably –- a general salary adjustment (known in budget parlance as CEC, or change in employee compensation) for faculty and staff as well as other state employees. The Legislature has convened a previously dormant CEC committee, however, and it appears that the Legislature may consider some kind of independent CEC action.<br>
<br>
President Theophilus concluded his 1954 missive to the faculty on an aspirational note that resonates today: “May I … express the hope that our united efforts combined with a faith in the future will make possible the achievement of the tremendous possibilities of the University of Idaho.”<br>

<h3>Here's the Latest News from the University of Idaho</h3>
<strong>Greenhouse Gas Emissions Decrease On UI Campus.</strong> As the uncertainty regarding future climate change looms overhead, the university is doing its part to curb greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, emissions during 2011 on the UI campus decreased 12.5 percent compared to 2005.&nbsp; The university conducts an annual GHG inventory in accordance with the requirements of the American College and University Presidents’ Climate Commitment – a Carnegie initiative in which most U.S.-based colleges and universities participate. The UI signaled its commitment to climate neutrality by signing the Talloires Declaration in 2005. The UI joined the Chicago Climate Exchange and ACUPCC in 2007. The Talloires Declaration and ACUPCC both call for the higher education community to provide leadership in addressing climate change.<a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20150907061048/http://www.uidaho.edu/newsevents/item?name=greenhouse-gas-emissions-decrease-on-ui-campus""><strong> Read more.</strong></a><br>

<strong>Prof Works with International Team To Study Plants Adaptation To Cold. </strong>A team of plant researchers including University of Idaho biologist David Tank has assembled the largest dated evolutionary tree, using it to show the order in which flowering plants evolved specific strategies, such as the seasonal shedding of leaves, to move into areas with cold winters. The results will be published Dec. 22 in the journal<em> Nature</em>. Early flowering plants are thought to have been woody — maintaining a prominent stem above ground across years and changing weather conditions, such as maple trees — and restricted to warm, wet tropical environments. But they have since put down roots in chillier climates, dominating large swaths of the globe where freezing occurs. How they managed this expansion has long vexed researchers searching for plants’ equivalent to the winter parka. <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20150907061048/http://www.uidaho.edu/newsevents/item?name=ui-prof-works-with-international-team-to-study-how-plants-evolved-to-weather-the-cold""><strong>Read more.</strong></a><br>

<strong>Donors Leave A Legacy Of Help For International Studies Students. </strong>Thanks to the foresight of the late Victor H. Skiles ’40 and his wife, Ruth Nay Skiles, the <strong><a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20150907061048/http://www.uidaho.edu/class/martin-institute"">University of Idaho Martin Institute</a> </strong>continues to help students seeking Foreign Service careers. After graduation, Skiles worked for several federal government agencies, but much of his career was spent in the U.S. Agency for International Development where he led U.S. assistance efforts worldwide, including Israel, Africa and South Asia. In 1973, he was appointed as the USAID Representative to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization. He retired in 1978. In 2006, Victor and Ruth established the Skiles Endowment for International Affairs to provide scholarships for students in the International Studies Program. Because of the impact international experience had on the Skiles, a preference is given to students studying abroad and those seeking to enter the Foreign Service. While Victor passed away in 2011, Ruth continues to support the couple’s scholarship. In 2013, Ruth notified the university that she had provided for a gift to the Skiles Endowment in her estate plans, and in December, she made a generous gift to the scholarship for immediate use. For information about establishing your legacy at the University of Idaho, contact Sharon Morgan at (208) 885-5760 or <a href=""mailto:morgans@uidaho.edu"">morgans@uidaho.edu</a>.</div>"

<span style=""color:#000000"">Dear Friends,</span><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<span style=""color:#000000"">We teach what we know. That seems self-evident, but it carries an important corollary: the knowledge we transmit to our students -- or share beyond the academic community through scholarly exchange and community outreach &ndash;- is either generated by ourselves or acquired from others. A great university does not rely solely upon acquired knowledge; it contributes new knowledge through research and creative activity worthy of a place of distinction among academic institutions.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I have such a university in mind. You will not be surprised to learn that it is Idaho&rsquo;s founding, comprehensive, constitutionally established, national land-grant research institution! It is a flagship propelled by the spirit of discovery. It is the University of Idaho.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Consider a few recent examples of research and creative activity by our faculty, staff, and students:</span>

<ul>
	<li><span style=""color:#000000"">A majestic panorama the of the planet Saturn and its satellite system, as it would be seen by human eyes, was unveiled last fall in a <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/newsevents/item?name=ui-researchers-help-decode-new-view-of-saturns-moon-titan-contribute-to-cassini-mission"" target=""_self"">new mosaic from NASA&#39;s Cassini mission</a>. It sweeps 404,880 miles across Saturn and its inner ring system, extending out to the E-ring. In the words of UI physics professor Matt Hedman, a participating scientist (along with four UI students), the Cassini spacecraft provides &ldquo;a completely different perspective than we could ever get from Earth. Basically, it is an eclipse of the sun by Saturn, so we are seeing light filtered through the planet&#39;s atmosphere and the rings&hellip;. Seeing Saturn and its rings backlit by the sun like this not only provides us with unique scientific information, it makes for an exceptionally beautiful image.&rdquo;</span><br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><span style=""color:#000000"">Closer to home, UI researchers are studying the ways society and landscapes are interconnected, thanks to a $20 million grant announced last year by the National Science Foundation (NSF). Over the course of five years, researchers will investigate the patterns and effects of growth in three of Idaho&rsquo;s mid-sized urban areas near sagebrush, forest and agricultural landscapes: Boise/Treasure Valley, Coeur d&rsquo;Alene/Post Falls and Pocatello/Idaho Falls. The research is a collaborative effort of faculty at the UI together with colleagues at Idaho State University, Boise State University, and other higher education institutions. &ldquo;A major benefit of this project will be improved public understanding of ecosystems and their public benefits,&rdquo; said Peter Goodwin, Idaho NSF Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) project director. &ldquo;A greater ability to provide science-based information to support policy and management decisions will help protect and improve quality of life and the health of our ecosystems in Idaho.&rdquo;</span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><span style=""color:#000000"">Late last year the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that it had&nbsp; awarded nearly $10 million to an academic, industry, and government consortium -&ndash; including researchers at the University of Idaho -&ndash; to study the major challenges limiting the use of insect-killed trees in the Rockies as a sustainable resource for bioenergy. &ldquo;The key idea in this project is to create a new industry,&rdquo; said Jay O&rsquo;Laughin, the University of Idaho team leader on the project and director of the Policy Analysis Group in the UI College of Natural Resources. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very exciting, because we&rsquo;re going to take something that&rsquo;s basically a waste and turn it into a resource.&rdquo;</span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><span style=""color:#000000"">In 2013 the National Institutes of Health awarded the University of Idaho a five-year grant for $5.1 million in continued support of the <a href=""http://www.ibest.uidaho.edu/"" target=""_self"">Institute for Bioinformatics and Evolutionary Studies (IBEST)</a>. The grant will fund a number of projects within IBEST, which encompasses multiple research and education programs, along with students, faculty, staff and facilities, related to real-time evolution. &ldquo;This will enable us to network with scientists from other institutions and strengthen our research programs.&rdquo; said Larry Forney, IBEST director and University Distinguished Professor of biological sciences at U-Idaho. &ldquo;You collaborate with the best people you can, wherever you are.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><span style=""color:#000000"">In a similar spirit of collaboration, a team of plant researchers including UI biologist David Tank has assembled the largest dated evolutionary tree, using it to show the order in which flowering plants have evolved specific strategies, such as the seasonal shedding of leaves, to move into areas with cold winters. The results were published last month the journal <em>Nature</em>.</span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><span style=""color:#000000"">Discovering ways to reduce energy consumption by using renewable resources, University of Idaho architecture students have earned recognition for their &ldquo;Best Use of Idaho Wood&rdquo; research. The students have developed designs for wood-based structures that meet net-zero energy criteria, such as producing electricity on site with photovoltaics and capturing enough water from the roof for plumbing and covered vegetation.</span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><span style=""color:#000000"">Whether investigating vehicle crash risks, making streets safer for pedestrians, or engineering low-emission snowmobiles, researchers in the&nbsp; <a href=""http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/niatt/"" target=""_self"">University of Idaho&rsquo;s National Institute for Advanced Transportation Technology</a> are designing the transportation systems of the future. The institute, known as NIATT, received a boost last September with a $570,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation. The award is part of a $3.4 million grant to the Northwest&rsquo;s USDOT-funded Regional University Transportation Center at the University of Washington.</span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><span style=""color:#000000"">And &hellip; earlier last year, the UI Library announced the release of Digital Initiatives&#39; latest collection, &ldquo;<a href=""http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/turning/index.html"" target=""_self"">The Turning of the Wheel Collection: A Digital Collection of Humanities Events.</a>&rdquo; The Turning of the Wheel Collection is a compilation of videos, photographs and transcripts documenting over 30 scholarly presentations and events that took place as part of the Turning of the Wheel Humanities Colloquium Series, a &quot;Humanities Exploration of the University of Idaho.&quot; The series was directed by Rodney Frey, director of general education and professor of ethnography, in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology. </span></li>
</ul>
<span style=""color:#000000"">As noted in previous Friday Letters, &ldquo;making the world a better place&rdquo; may be a<br>
time-worn phrase, but at the University of Idaho we have people doing exactly that every day. Their work advances human progress, informs our teaching, and shapes our outreach to communities in Idaho and elsewhere. Most fundamentally, it expresses the spirit of discovery that puts wind in our sails.</span><br>

Rowell recently established an endowed scholarship that will allow agricultural economics students to take their studies beyond our national borders. &ldquo;The J.D. Rowell Scholarship Endowment for International Studies with Agricultural Economics creates a unique opportunity to integrate overseas studies into our program, giving our students great experiences that will make them more competitive in today&rsquo;s global marketplace,&rdquo; said Dean John Foltz. During his long career with the California Department of Food and Agriculture, Rowell spent time in Brazil, inspiring a passion for international work. His recent gift was funded through a gift from his IRA and by establishing a charitable remainder trust. While he is not a UI graduate himself, Rowell&rsquo;s family has strong ties to the university. His brother and both of his parents were alumni and his grandfather took classes before the university was officially organized. &ldquo;I feel a deep connection to the University of Idaho and want to give back to honor my family name,&rdquo; said Rowell.

<span style=""color:#000000"">Dear Friends,<br>
&nbsp;<br>
This week the University of Idaho has begun to celebrate 125 years of service to the State of Idaho. During a well-attended ceremony inside the state capitol, Governor C. L. &ldquo;Butch&rdquo; Otter -- surrounded by a standing-room-only assemblage of Vandal students and supporters -- signed a proclamation noting our university&rsquo;s &ldquo;lasting contributions to the State&rdquo; and declaring next Thursday, January 30, 2014, to be &ldquo;University of Idaho 125th Anniversary Day.&rdquo; He cheerfully received a bear hug from &ldquo;Joe Vandal,&rdquo; and later visited a celebratory gala in downtown Boise attended by a sell-out crowd including UI alumni Senator Jim Risch and Lieutenant Governor Brad Little.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The Governor signed his &ldquo;Anniversary Day&rdquo; proclamation in advance of January 30 because the halls of the state capitol have been filled with Vandal advocates during the University of Idaho&rsquo;s annual &ldquo;legislative week.&rdquo; (Needless to say, it is only fitting that the actual anniversary date will be commemorated in Moscow &ndash; the location specified in the state constitution for Idaho&rsquo;s founding, comprehensive, national land-grant university.)<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Among the most effective advocates for the University of Idaho have been 34 volunteer students who traveled to Boise from Moscow this week. Coordinated by ASUI President Max Cohen and ASUI student lobbyist Ashley Morehouse, the students met with legislators and urged support for public higher education. One student reported, &ldquo;I was amazed at how friendly everyone was and how interested they were in hearing from us.&rdquo; The student recounted a nearly two-hour discussion with one legislator who wanted to learn more from a student&rsquo;s perspective.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
This week also featured a packed &ldquo;Meet the Vandals&rdquo; student recruitment event. Some 232 prospective students from the Treasure Valley -&ndash; a 23 percent increase over last year -&ndash; eagerly quizzed faculty, staff, and current students about life and learning in Moscow. Dozens of the prospective students enrolled on the spot. Many parents expressed thanks for &ldquo;bringing the University of Idaho to Boise.&rdquo;&nbsp;They appreciated hearing about our connected, safe community. One first-generation, multicultural student from Weiser, said that prior to the event her parents felt uneasy about her attending a school away from home. At the conclusion of the event, however, the concerned mother hugged the event coordinator and said it was clear that &ldquo;Vandals truly care about Vandals.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
This week also featured a meeting of the Higher Education Presidents Council with the Governor, as well as university presentations to the Legislature&rsquo;s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee (JFAC), the Senate Education Committee, and the House Education Committee. At JFAC, the University of Idaho was first up. &ldquo;What a great way to start off our institutions of higher learning,&rdquo; noted Senator Dean Cameron, who chaired the JFAC hearing that day. We will learn later in the legislative session, of course, how the University of Idaho&rsquo;s requests and the Governor&rsquo;s education proposals have fared; but we certainly have received a gracious and collegial reception in all venues.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Another highlight of this week has been the news that our capital campaign (&ldquo;Inspiring Futures&rdquo;) reached a level of $207 million in gifts and pledges at the end of December, 2013. This means that in approximately 85% of the allotted time for the campaign, we have achieved 92% of our $225 million campaign goal. The last six months of 2013 have been particularly heartening; we set fiscal year-to-date records for donors and dollars in many giving categories. The gifts will support student scholarships, faculty research, programmatic initiatives, and facility upgrades. This private support will complement and leverage the public support sought in the halls, offices, and meeting rooms of the state capitol this week.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
As I reflect upon our university&rsquo;s 125 years -&ndash; five quarters of a century &ndash; I am reminded of something I learned while working in Kentucky, before I happily returned to my native Idaho. The fastest time in the Kentucky Derby &ndash;- a race five quarters of a mile long -&ndash; was posted by Secretariat, who ran every quarter mile faster than the quarter preceding it. He was accelerating all the way.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
And so are we. Every quarter-century has brought new advances for the University of Idaho. As we end our fifth quarter, there is a strong and growing wind in our sails. Idaho&rsquo;s flagship is accelerating.<br>
<br>
Go Vandals!<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<span style=""color:#000000""><strong>Professor Unearths Surprising Geology Deep Beneath The Gal&aacute;pagos Islands.</strong> UI Geologist Dennis Geist is digging deep into the mysteries of one of Earth&rsquo;s most unusual island chains, the Gal&aacute;pagos. He and a team of researchers from across the nation have published a paper that challenges some of the conventional explanations of how the islands&rsquo; geology has formed. Geist describes the rock layer deep below the Gal&aacute;pagos as a sponge. Traditional views held it was a &ldquo;dry&rdquo; sponge, just hot rocks. But Geist and his colleagues&rsquo; data indicate the sponge is actually &ldquo;wet&rdquo; with hot magma. Their research, reported in the February issue of the journal Nature Geosciences and released online Jan. 19, is key to a fundamental scientific understanding of how the Gal&aacute;pagos -&ndash; and other islands &ndash;- formed.</span> <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/newsevents/item?name=ui-professor-unearths-the-surprising-geology-deep-beneath-the-galpagos-islands"" target=""_self""><strong>Read more.</strong></a><br>

<span style=""color:#000000""><strong>Furgason Family Creates A Legacy To Attract Women To Engineering. </strong>Robert &ldquo;Bob&rdquo; Furgason, PhD, &rsquo;56, &rsquo;58,&rsquo;06 (honorary doctorate), has been a champion for female engineers at the University of Idaho for decades. As head of the university&rsquo;s chemical engineering department from 1965-1974, he initiated the first student chapter of the Society of Women Engineers here. The support continues today as he and his wife Gloria &rsquo;81 recently pledged $250,000 to create a new scholarship endowment. &ldquo;The Robert and Gloria Furgason Family Engineering Scholarship Endowment will make a difference by encouraging and enabling more women to become engineers at the University of Idaho,&rdquo; said Larry Stauffer, dean of the College of Engineering. The Furgasons are no strangers to the university. In addition to both being alumni, Bob served as dean of the College of Engineering in 1974, and four years later, became the vice president for academic affairs and research. The couple currently resides in Corpus Christi, Texas where they are known as leaders and champions for many non-profits. They have two sons, Steven &rsquo;88 and Brian.

<span style=""color:#000000"">Dear Friends,<br>
&nbsp;</span><br>
<span style=""color:#000000"">Yesterday we had a birthday party, and it was a dandy. In a festooned Idaho Commons building -- with an overflow crowd filling the main floor, and more observers elbowing for a view from three circling balcony levels &ndash; we celebrated our 125<sup>th</sup> anniversary. The festive setting resembled Shakespeare&rsquo;s Globe Theatre.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The celebration, video-streamed from Moscow to other University of Idaho locations around the state, featured a reading of Governor Otter&rsquo;s proclamation declaring January 30, 2014, as &ldquo;University of Idaho 225<sup>th</sup> Anniversary Day,&rdquo; as well as congratulatory communications from our Board of Regents, the City of Moscow, and Latah County. President-designate Dr. Chuck Staben, who will take office on March 1, came from South Dakota to join the celebration. The renowned Vandaleers sang, the nation&rsquo;s best marching band played an imaginative blend of &ldquo;Go Vandals Go&rdquo; and &ldquo;Happy Birthday,&rdquo; the Spirit Squad exhorted the audience, and Joe Vandal danced.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
History has smiled upon us. As our state&rsquo;s national land-grant, founding, comprehensive, and constitutionally recognized university, the University of Idaho is the historic flagship of Idaho higher education. Today, we are members of a higher education fleet, fulfilling our statewide leadership responsibilities through collaboration with highly valued sister institutions.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
In 1889, of course, we were the only ship in the fleet. Our early voyages were not without difficulty. The University moved slowly from existence on paper to full operation. In 1892, at an initial gathering of students, then-President Franklin B. Gault noted that there were no chairs on which to sit. Adapting nimbly to the situation, he said, &ldquo;It is not every college which can give its students academic standing on the first day.&rdquo; During an interview of a faculty candidate seeking to teach the classics, President Gault stated that the job would also involve milking cows. When the candidate inquired by what law he could be required to perform such a task, Gault replied, &ldquo;By the greatest law of all -- the law of necessity.&rdquo; The candidate withdrew.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Despite such resource struggles, the founders of the university had high ideals. They wrote into the territorial act, and later into the Idaho Constitution, a governance structure based upon a regent model rather than a legislative model.&nbsp; By creating an independent Board of Regents, and giving it constitutional authority, our founders adopted the most forward-looking wisdom of the day about the governance of institutions of higher learning.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
In keeping with the spirit of the Morrill Act (1862) that created the nation&rsquo;s system of land-grant universities (described as &ldquo;the people&rsquo;s universities&rdquo; by President Lincoln), our university became a &ldquo;people&rsquo;s gateway&rdquo; of opportunity.&nbsp; The University of Idaho&rsquo;s first graduating class, in 1896, included two men and two women &mdash; Stella Allen, Florence Corbett, Charles Kirtley, and Arthur Adair.&nbsp; In 1899, Jennie Hughes became the first African American graduate. Today, we are still the gateway. More than 35 percent of the students in our most recent entering class are the first in their families to attend a university.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Advancing another dimension of the Morrill Act, the University has spurred economic development. The University&rsquo;s prominent role in agriculture, for example, can be traced to the confluence of the Morrill Act with the subsequent Hatch Act (1887), which created experimental stations at land-grant institutions, and with the Smith-Lever Act (1914), which provided for cooperative extension services. The University of Idaho opened its first experiment station even before it welcomed students to the Moscow campus. Today there are high-tech experiment stations around the state. The University also provides extension and outreach in all 44 Idaho counties; indeed, it opened an extension office at Boise as early as 1910. The partnership between our University and state&rsquo;s agricultural industry has propelled Idaho to the third-highest level of production among western states -&ndash; trailing only California and (by a small margin) the State of Washington.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Many other colleges, institutes and centers have sprung from the University&rsquo;s roots. Our Colleges of Natural Resources, Law, and Art &amp; Architecture fulfill statewide missions. Other colleges conduct vital programs in Letters, Arts &amp; Social Sciences as well as Business &amp; Economics, Education, Engineering, Science, and the College of Graduate Studies. All of them contribute to our distinctive identity as <em>both</em> a land-grant institution <em>and</em> a founding, comprehensive university.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
From these roots have grown academic programs with a long-standing reputation for high quality, enabling our students to find high-quality jobs. In 2012, Payscale.com rated the University of Idaho as the 11<sup>th</sup> best school in the intermountain region for jobs with solid pay secured by graduates. If specialty aviation and mining disciplines were set aside, the University of Idaho ranked 7<sup>th</sup> -- ahead of all schools in Utah, New Mexico, Montana, Wyoming, Nevada, and most schools in Colorado and Arizona.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
In the coming months, we will continue to celebrate the past and present in our quasquicentennial (fifth quarter of a century) anniversary observance. We&rsquo;ll take our birthday party &ldquo;on the road&rdquo; to additional locations around the state. On each occasion, we will proudly recall our distinctive history, recommit to our collaborative leadership role in Idaho higher education, and reaffirm the familiar inscription found in the Administration Building&rsquo;s arched entry: &ldquo;Erected by the Commonwealth of Idaho for the training of her future citizens to their highest usefulness in private life and public service.&rdquo; At Idaho&rsquo;s first university, we are still moved by those words.</span><br>

<span style=""color:#000000"">Dear Friends,<br>
&nbsp;</span><br>
<span style=""color:#000000"">In more ways than one, Dr. Donald R. Theophilus is a towering figure in our University&rsquo;s storied history. While serving as president from 1954 to 1965, he became famous for insisting on high standards of academic performance. He did not mince words about it. At the beginning of each academic year, he would bluntly tell the incoming undergraduates, &ldquo;For you to achieve less than your full ability is a disgrace to you.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Yet he was also warmly supportive of students who applied themselves. During his presidency, the University broadened its financial aid offerings, established an advanced placement pathway for talented high school students, and &ndash;- perhaps most memorably &ndash;- created the precursor to our current University Honors Program. Today, Theophilus Tower, the tallest building on the Moscow campus, provides a home for newly arriving Honors Program students.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<strong>Center For Excellence</strong><br>
<br>
Our &ldquo;crested hill&quot;, as the Moscow campus has been called, is not the geographical center of Idaho; but it emphatically is, and has long been, a premier center of excellence in Idaho higher education. As regular readers of the &ldquo;Friday Letter&rdquo; know, <em>Newsweek </em>magazine in 1947 published a study showing that the University of Idaho had produced more Rhodes Scholars up to that time than any other university -&ndash; public or private &ndash;- west of the Great Lakes.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
In recent years our students have earned national recognition as Fulbright, Goldwater, Truman, and Udall Scholars. The University of Idaho is home to one of the highest proportions of National Merit Scholars in the Pacific Northwest. The best and brightest college-bound students of Idaho, and of surrounding states, are attracted by the reputation of our faculty and by our Honors Program.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<strong>Students With Talent And Motivation</strong><br>
<br>
The <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/honors"" target=""_self"">Honors Program</a> embraces students with high potential; it is not limited by formulaic credentials. As noted in the program&rsquo;s inaugural announcement, published in 1959, the program &ldquo;is intended to provide the student with more intensive training, and/or research experience, than is ordinarily available to the undergraduate.&rdquo; <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/honors/people/featuredstudents"" target=""_self"">Students who aspire to high challenges</a>, and are ready and willing to meet them, can apply. Some honors students are the first in their families ever to attend college, but they have a history of personal achievement and they take a back seat to no one in talent and motivation. Currently, the program boasts more than 400 extraordinarily hard-working participants. They span the academic disciplines; indeed, many have double, triple and even quadruple majors.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&ldquo;This is one way you can receive a private college education at a public institution,&rdquo; says <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/honors/people/Staff/altoncampbell"" target=""_self"">Professor Alton Campbell</a>, program director. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not about the tuition or the buildings, it&rsquo;s about the nature of your peer group, and these students are exceptional &ndash; they&rsquo;re exciting.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/class/english/thomasdrake"" target=""_self"">Tom Drake</a>, an active supporter of the program and English instructor, has observed: &ldquo;Decades ago, when I was an undergrad, a friend of mine who&rsquo;d attended Stanford pointed out that &hellip; [education is] is not a function of where you are &hellip; but who you are, and how hard you work at making the most of your opportunities.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<strong>Comparable To The Ivys</strong><br>
<br>
Honors Program students have an exceptional work ethic.&nbsp; <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/sci/chem/faculty/thomasbitterwolf"" target=""_self"">Professor Tom Bitterwolf,</a> a 25-year faculty veteran of the program, puts it this way: &ldquo;The Honors Program allows us to educate &hellip; at a level that I would put up against any of the Ivys. Many [of our students] could have gone to an Ivy League school but the realities of finances and family obligations made that impossible. We challenge them, stretch them, demand too much of them and they come back for more. Not all students are able or willing to seek excellence; but for those who are, the Honors Program is here for them.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The program provides three primary components: a robust academic emphasis, unique living arrangements, and a wide array of extracurricular activities that promote growth and community. The program&rsquo;s emphasis on the &ldquo;whole person&rdquo; reinforces a Vandal ideal for all students, and it pays a lifetime of dividends.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Alumni agree. Melanie Coonts Samuel, Ph.D., who graduated in 2002 with majors in microbiology, molecular biology/biochemistry, and English, before going on to do postdoctoral work at Harvard, has written: &quot;In Freshman Honors Chemistry, I met friends &hellip; who I believe will be friends for a lifetime. Honors Program classes excite and stimulate. They have defined my university experience and helped me see the world from new and varied perspectives.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Again, Professor Bitterwolf: &ldquo;The Honors Program is a beacon on the hill. It is what higher education was meant to be -- intellectually vibrant, challenging and exciting, educating the leaders of tomorrow. The UI Honors Program is justifiably one of the brightest jewels in the university&#39;s crown. I&#39;m proud to be a small part of it.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<strong>High Ambiitons</strong><br>
&nbsp;<br>
When President Theophilus welcomed our incoming students, he challenged every one of them &ndash; within and beyond the Honors Program -- to fulfill their individual potential. &ldquo;[Y]ou have sufficient native ability,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;What you will have to prove is that you have motivation &ndash;- the kind of motivation which will make it possible for you &hellip; to develop an appreciation of individual responsibility, an ability to evaluate events, a sense of judgment in human affairs and an ability to enjoy the good things of life.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&ldquo;We should cultivate our souls as well as our minds,&rdquo; he would say. And then in closing, he would add, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget: Write the folks at home who love and cherish you and whose ambitions for you are so high.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
As we enter our University&rsquo;s 126<sup>th</sup> year, we still hear President Theophilus&rsquo; words of challenge and warmth -- and our ambitions for our students remain high.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br>
<br>
<span style=""color:#000000"">Go Vandals!<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Sincerely,<br>
<br>

<span style=""color:#000000""><strong>International Studies Director Discusses Abundance Of Politics At Olympics.</strong> While the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia are focused on international sporting competition, the underlying political tensions between countries are playing themselves out. Anti-gay legislation and resulting protests and terrorism threats are already grabbing headlines. Director of the Martin Institute and the International Studies Program, Bill Smith, has been discussing with the media about the Olympics and its impact on the United States and the international community. &ldquo;While the Olympics promote international sporting events that are not political, by their nature, they become political when you include so many nations in direct competition in front of a global television audience,&rdquo; said Smith. &ldquo;In addition to sport, the Olympics provides a whole multitude of avenues of cross cultural, cross-country interactions.&rdquo;<strong> <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/newsevents/item?name=university-of-idaho-international-studies-program-director-breaks-down-politics-of-non-political-olympics"" target=""_self"">Read more.</a></strong><br>

<strong>UI Team Studies Narco-deforestation In Central America. </strong>A group of UI researchers found something unexpected during their work in Central America:&nbsp; drug trafficking is leaving deep scars on sensitive landscape. The research team, including Erik Nielsen, a UI alumnus, and Spencer Plumb, a UI doctoral student, were focused on sustainable practices, geography and earth sciences when they noticed signs of &ldquo;narco-deforestation.&rdquo; In a Jan. 31 Science magazine entry, they noted drug traffickers are slashing forests, often within protected areas, to carve clandestine landing strips and roads, and to establish cattle ranches through which drug money can be laundered. <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/newsevents/item?name=ui-team-researches-price-of-drug-trafficking-on-forests-in-central-america"" target=""_self""><strong>Read more.</strong></a></span><br>

Terry earned</span><span style=""color:#000000""> his master and doctoral degrees from the University of Idaho, at which time he began his 40-year career with the institution. Terry&rsquo;s legacy will live on through the many people he inspired, his lifetime service to education and his now-famous Found Money Fund. Started with just three pennies the fund has grown to more than $333,000 thanks to the help of many Vandals. Terry and his wife Patricia have faithfully given to the university for 30 years, including the endowment of a scholarship in the College of Education. At the request of Terry and his family, memorials should be made to the Terry Armstrong Classroom for Science Education fund. This classroom will be dedicated to science teaching innovation and excellence after the <a href=""http://[link to: http://www.uidaho.edu/inspire/ways/academics/college-of-education]"" target=""_self"">upcoming College of Education Building renovation</a></span><span style=""color:#000000"">.

<span style=""color:#000000"">Dear Friends,</span><br>
<br>
<span style=""color:#000000"">A great university &ndash; shall we say Idaho&rsquo;s national land-grant, founding, comprehensive, constitutional, and (therefore) flagship university? &ndash; may have many physical campuses, but it always has a single symbolic address. It is located at the intersection of thought and action.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Every year the University of Idaho welcomes new faculty, students, and staff to this distinctive address. Through a rich array of speaker programs, we also welcome eminent visitors who can share experiences and perspectives drawn from lives filled with thought and action. They inspire us to work harder and reach higher.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<strong>Borah</strong><br>
Illustrations abound. This spring our Borah Symposium will feature General Richard Myers, whose abundant life has encompassed careers as an airman, businessman, philanthropist, and chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff.&nbsp; General Myers will join nationally known scholars, in a program titled <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/class/borah/borah-2014"" target=""_self"">&ldquo;WWI and the Making of the Modern World: 1914-2014.&rdquo;</a> Named for Senator William E. Borah (the &ldquo;Lion of Idaho&rdquo;), the symposium over the years has attracted Nobel Laureates Oscar Arias, Lech Walesa, and Frederik de Klerk; Irish peace activist Betty Williams; and a host of other national and international figures including UI alumnus Philip Habib, one of the most distinguished diplomats in American history.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<strong>Bellwood</strong><br>
The <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/law/newsandevents/signature/bellwood-lectures"" target=""_self"">Sherman J. Bellwood Memorial Lecture</a> brings prominent jurists and national leaders to Idaho. Supported by the University&rsquo;s largest speaker endowment, and named for an esteemed Idaho trial judge, the Bellwood series has featured U.S. Supreme Court Justices Sandra Day O&rsquo;Connor, Antonin Scalia, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and the Chief Justice of the United States, John Roberts, who helped the College of Law celebrate its centennial in 2009.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<strong>McClure</strong><br>
The <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/class/signatureprograms/mcclurecenter"" target=""_self"">McClure Lectures on Science and Public Policy,</a> aim to strengthen the relationship between science and public policy-making. Named for another distinguished UI alumnus, the late U.S. Senator James A. McClure, this lecture series has featured Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Douglas Brinkley, award-winning journalists Mark Trahant and Howard Berkes, and UI alumnus Dale Bosworth, then-chief of the U.S. Forest Service.<br>
<br>
<strong>Hemingway</strong><br>
This week has provided another reminder of how the University of Idaho occupies the crossroads of thought and action. The University conferred the <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/class/hemingway"" target=""_self"">Ernest Hemingway/PEN award</a> for excellence in a first work of fiction upon Kevin Powers, author of the critically acclaimed novel <em>The Yellow Birds</em>. Powers has spent the week in Moscow, participating in colloquia with English Department faculty and students. The award was made by the <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/class/hemingway/connection"" target=""_self"">University of Idaho in collaboration with the Ernest Hemingway Foundation and Society.</a><br>
&nbsp;<br>
The University&rsquo;s close relationship with the foundation, established by Ernest&rsquo;s widow, Mary Hemingway, reflects &ldquo;Papa&rdquo; Hemingway&rsquo;s bond to Idaho. Literary historians tell us that &ldquo;Papa&rdquo; wrote portions of <em>For Whom the Bell Tolls</em>, <em>Islands in the Stream</em>, and <em>The Garden of Eden</em>, and worked extensively on <em>The Sun Also Rises </em>and <em>A Moveable Feast,</em> during his visits to the Wood River Valley of Idaho. He ultimately spent his final his days in Ketchum, Idaho, where the &ldquo;Hemingway House&rdquo; still stands. The annual Hemingway Festival is hosted each year at Sun Valley by the University of Idaho. The Hemingway/PEN award and the Hemingway Festival are crystals in a chandelier of luminous events celebrating the arts in Idaho.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<strong>Jazz Festival</strong><br>
Another crystal will catch the light next week, when the University of Idaho hosts the renowned<a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/JAZZFEST"" target=""_self""> Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival</a>, winner of the National Medal of the Arts, bestowed by the President of the United States &ndash;- the first such medal ever bestowed upon a public university. The festival, now in its 47<sup>th</sup> year, will attract thousands of music students to Moscow, where they will enjoy a unique opportunity to participate in several days of workshops with a star-studded lineup of jazz artists. And then, each night, the stars will come out, performing in a special venue created within the Kibbie Dome. If you haven&rsquo;t seen this magical event, you should come; and if you can&rsquo;t come this year, put it on your &ldquo;bucket list.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<strong>Human Rights</strong><br>
Each January, our University joins with the<a href=""http://humanrightslatah.org"" target=""_self""> Latah County Human Rights Task Force&nbsp; </a>in celebrating human rights week, and in co-sponsoring a Martin Luther King, Jr., Human Rights breakfast attended by hundreds of community members. Our speakers have included state and national civil rights leaders. This year I had the special pleasure of inviting <a href=""http://www.evergreen.edu/president/purcebio.htm"" target=""_self"">Dr. Thomas L. (&ldquo;Les&rdquo;) Purce</a></span><span style=""color:#000000"">, a fellow Idaho native and childhood friend, to speak about diversity, equality, and leadership on our Moscow campus and to address the breakfast gathering.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Combining energy with a positive attitude, and bringing out the best in people around him, Les demonstrated in his remarks the characteristics that enabled him to become Mayor of Pocatello (Idaho&rsquo;s first elected black public official); to serve in leadership positions at Idaho administrative agencies, Idaho State University and Washington State University; and most recently, to enter his 14<sup>th</sup> year as President of Evergreen State College in Washington. At the end of his breakfast presentation, he pulled out a guitar and sang a ballad about a child who thought she could fly, even if those around her snickered. The final lines of the ballad, as I recall, were:<br>
&nbsp;</span>

<div style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""color:#000000"">She never thought she couldn&rsquo;t fly,<br>
And, so, one day, she did.</span></div>
<span style=""color:#000000"">&nbsp;<br>
The University of Idaho is a place where people learn to do more than is expected of them. Our founders intended this place to be special, and their intent has been carried forward in our legacy of esteemed visitors. One of our first luminary speakers, Theodore Roosevelt -&ndash; the embodiment of thought and action -- stood on a platform of Idaho wheat and told the assembled crowd. &ldquo;I know that the university represents that which shall count in the state tomorrow, and that it makes possible the growth in the &hellip; years to come.&rdquo;&nbsp; Today, we are fulfilling his prophecy.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Go Vandals!&nbsp; Fly!<br>

<span style=""color:#000000"">Dear Friends,</span><br>
<span style=""color:#000000"">&nbsp;<br>
In 1950, University of Idaho President Jesse Buchanan told students in an open letter, &ldquo;Attending the University is important to both you and your country. The strength of our nation is based upon a continuing production of well-trained young men and women &ndash;- well-trained in all fields of knowledge vital to progress&hellip;.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
A university underwrites our country&rsquo;s progress when it provides educational rigor &ndash;- that is, when it simultaneously challenges students and enables them to post records of achievement worthy of national recognition. One of our most notable alumni, the late U.S. Senator James McClure &rsquo;50, discovered first-hand the meaning of academic rigor at the University of Idaho. &ldquo;I managed to be a good student in high school,&rdquo; he later told a biographer (W. Smallwood, <em>McClure of Idaho</em>, 2007), &ldquo;but I never really learned how to study.&rdquo; He eventually surmounted that challenge, yet the University demanded more. In one semester he posted A&rsquo;s in all of his courses with a single exception where a professor gave him a B -- not because his work had fallen short of A quality, because the professor believed he had the ability to do even better.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<strong>National Scholars</strong><br>
<br>
Senator McClure&rsquo;s formative experience was what we might call &ldquo;tough love&rdquo; today. The teacher-scholars on the University of Idaho faculty genuinely want our students to excel, and the results are heartening. We produce a remarkable number of national scholars, especially those in the Goldwater, Udall, Fulbright, and Boren programs. Last year, for example, our University produced two of the prestigious Goldwater Scholars selected from a nationwide field of mathematics, science, and engineering students. We had one of only 50 Udall scholars chosen from a field of 488 finalists in the environmental track -&ndash; the most heavily contested of the Udall programmatic tracks. Within the past two years our University also has produced a Fulbright Scholar in both the student and faculty categories.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Our Boren Scholar roster is even more replete with recent Vandals. This program, administered by the U.S. State Department, provides a small number of full-ride scholarships each year for American undergraduates to live and learn in areas of the world critical to interests of the United States. Recently, we have had UI Boren Scholars in China, Bangladesh, and Azerbaijan.<br>
<br>
<strong>High Performers</strong><br>
<br>
In other categories of distinction, our College of Agriculture &amp; Life Sciences has produced a winner of the National Science Foundation Undergraduate Research Fellowship in Mathematical Biology. Students at the College of Business &amp; Economics have placed 5<sup>th</sup> out of more than 1,600 competitors in the nationally recognized Business Plan Competition conducted at Rice University.&nbsp; Members of the University of Idaho Chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers swept the first three places in the Technical Research Exhibition held last fall in Los Angeles. Students in our interdisciplinary Martin Institute have won the top research award in the National Model United Nations Conference in 10 of the past 11 years. A student in our theatre arts program recently was selected as a national finalist for playwriting awards bestowed through the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., and another student&rsquo;s work was selected for inclusion in the National Festival. During this academic year, a UI Army ROTC cadet earned recognition as the second-highest rated cadet nationwide, chosen from a field of 5,478 students.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<strong>Licensure Exam Leaders</strong><br>
<br>
Further evidence of student achievement is revealed by the results of national licensure examinations. Graduates of the College of Law have a higher first-time pass rate on the Idaho Bar Exam -&ndash; a standard, uniform national examination &ndash;- than the average pass rate for first-time takers from other law schools. UI graduates had a first-time pass rate of 87% versus 81% for non-UI first-time takers on the summer 2012 uniform exam. In the summer of 2013, UI graduates again outscored non-UI takers with a first-time pass rate of 83% compared to 80% for first-time takers from other law schools.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Last year graduates of our College of Art &amp; Architecture posted an overall pass of 76% on the national architecture licensure exam, comparing favorably with such universities as Harvard (74%) and UCLA (70%). Especially impressive has been the success of our engineering students. Among those who have taken the national Fundamentals of Engineering Examination, the average pass rate in recent years has been 93% compared to a national average of 81%.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Want more evidence?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m just getting warmed up!&nbsp; It is not possible, however, to present a full compendium of student achievements within the space limitations of a single &ldquo;Friday Letter.&rdquo; The accomplishments mentioned above are simply illustrations of the excellence of students who embrace rigor and strive mightily. We are proud of all such students. They give us confidence in our university&rsquo;s enduring reputation, and in the strength of our beloved country.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><br>

<span style=""color:#000000""><strong>Library Releases &lsquo;Blindfold Test&rsquo; Collection For Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival. </strong>As part of this year&rsquo;s Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival, the University of Idaho has released the <a href=""http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu/cdm/blindfoldtests/collection/lfc"" target=""_self"">Leonard Feather Blindfold Tests Collection </a>a new collection of recorded interviews with jazz greats such as Duke Ellington and Dizzy Gillespie conducted by the British born jazz journalist and Bebop enthusiast Leonard Feather. They form a small, but important, part of the library&rsquo;s <a href=""http://www.ijc.uidaho.edu/"" target=""_self"">International Jazz Collections</a>, the premiere archive of historical jazz materials in the Northwest. The new collection focuses on a particular style of interview Feather utilized called a Blindfold Test. In a Blindfold Test, a subject is asked to listen to a piece of music by another artist. The subject is then asked to express their thoughts on the style and quality of the performance. In Feather&rsquo;s interviews, the subject often asserted the performer must be of a particular gender or race, only to find that prediction to be incorrect. Consequently, these interviews helped to breakdown preconceived notions of music, race and gender in the jazz world. <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/newsevents/item?name=ui-library-releases-blindfold-test-collection-as-part-of-lionel-hampton-jazz-festival"" target=""_self""><strong>Read more.</strong></a></span><br>

<span style=""color:#000000""><strong>Hot Jazz, Bright Futures Come Here Thanks To Carl Berry.</strong> The tradition of jazz has long been about giving, including giving players the chance to learn, grow and excel through education and mentoring. These same opportunities are what Carl G. Berry &rsquo;62, CEO of Star Resort Group and University of Idaho Foundation Board member, likes to see brought to the table at the University of Idaho. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important that we take advantage of the opportunity of having more than 4,000 young students on our campus during jazz festival,&rdquo; said Berry. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a great value here at the University of Idaho, and we want them to see that. They&rsquo;re not all going to become jazz musicians, but their experience here can certainly influence their choice of college.&rdquo; As former chairman of the Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival advisory board, Berry oversaw the development of the current inter-departmental workshop offerings, as well as the hiring of the current festival executive director. For nearly 40 years he and his wife, Linden, have financially supported numerous areas of the University including the jazz festival and the Linden and Carl Berry Excellence Scholarship Endowment.

<span style=""color:#000000"">Dear Friends,<br>
&nbsp;</span><br>
<span style=""color:#000000"">The snows of winter bring a quiet, austere beauty to the Arboretum on our Moscow campus. A white blanket covers the clearings and the frozen ponds.&nbsp; Deciduous trees from forests around the world stand silently in leafless clusters. Native evergreens and yellow tamaracks sway gently, adding color to a landscape of light and shadow.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Soon spring will come to the Arboretum. When it does, life will abound. Trees, shrubs, and flowers will burst forth in profusion. Geese, ducks, quail, and other wildlife will appear. As summer unfolds, <a href=""http://webpages.uidaho.edu/arboretum/tour.html"" target=""_self"">the Arboretum&rsquo;s walking paths</a> will be filled with strolling visitors. In the fall, when every brilliant hue is on display, the Arboretum will be a destination for artists, photographers, and lovers. In the winter, the cycle will begin again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<strong>A Symbol Of The Extraordinary</strong><br>
<br>
At all times of the year, whenever I recruit prospective students and new members of our faculty or staff, I take them &ndash;- if time permits -- to <a href=""http://webpages.uidaho.edu/arboretum/about.html"" target=""_self"">the Arboretum.</a> Invariably, they find it enchanting. I encourage them to think that a university able to create something this extraordinary is also capable of helping them rise above the ordinary in their own lives.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The Arboretum has not always been a place of enchantment, however. Until the 20<sup>th</sup> century, it was a tract of dusty hills and cheat grass. The transformation was a work of visionaries. You may not recognize the name of the first visionary, C. L. Price, but you probably have heard of his boss: Charles Houston Shattuck. In 1909 Price and Shattuck began the forestry program at the University, and in 1910 they began planting trees in the grove now known as the Shattuck Arboretum -- the first arboretum west of the Mississippi River. Price also beautified the campus by creating the iconic, tree-lined &ldquo;Hello Walk&rdquo; as well as the community of trees gracing the Administration Building lawn.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
In the late 1970s, the original arboretum vision was expanded to a 63-acre tract contiguous to the golf course -&ndash; an area we now call the &ldquo;new&rdquo; arboretum or, simply, &ldquo;the Arboretum.&rdquo; George Jagon, the University&rsquo;s director of physical plant, gained President Ernest Hartung&rsquo;s blessing to begin work on the site. By 1980, the University of Idaho Arboretum &amp; Botanical Garden had emerged. The University recognized the educational value of the Arboretum by naming botany professor Richard Naskali, Ph.D., as the Arboretum&rsquo;s coordinator and, ultimately, as the Arboretum&rsquo;s director. Dr. Naskali, in conjunction with horticulturalists Jake Leppart and Paul Warnick, a group of supporters who formed the Arboretum Associates, and a host of civic groups and volunteers, turned the dusty hills into a verdant complex. Through Dr. Naskali&rsquo;s leadership, the Arboretum earned a national ranking in the Morton Register of Arboreta. It became, and now is, part of the academic life of the University and a place of distinctive beauty on campus.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<strong>A Changing Season -- A New President</strong><br>
<br>
The story of the Arboretum illustrates how every generation works for the benefit of future generations. In the life of a university, there is a sequence of inter-generational giving and receiving, not unlike the sequence of seasons in the Arboretum itself. In leadership, there is a similar succession of seasons.&nbsp; Tomorrow, on March 1, 2014, <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/newsevents/presidential-announcement"" target=""_self"">Dr. Chuck Staben, the 18<sup>th</sup> President </a>of the University of Idaho will take office. He is, as many alumni and friends already know &ndash;- and as others will soon discover -- a splendid choice. His abundant talent and collegiality will enable him to bring forth the best in our academic community.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
For every arrival there is a departure, but I&rsquo;ll not travel far. When I carry the last cardboard box out of the president&rsquo;s office, I&rsquo;ll drive my old Subaru down the hill from the Administration Building back to the College of Law, where teaching, scholarship, and service await me as a faculty member. Karen and I have been humbled and honored to serve the University in our interim capacity. The service has enabled me to repay a family debt to the institution that opened a gateway of opportunity for my parents during the Great Depression.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
We have too many people to thank, but I want to acknowledge all of our unselfish administrative colleagues, faculty, and staff &ndash;- including Brett Morris, whose research and ideas have contributed to my joyful task of writing the &ldquo;Friday Letters.&rdquo; Thanks also to everyone who has taken time to read them.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Now, a wind is rising -- a sign of coming spring. Above the Arboretum&rsquo;s tree-lined hills, clouds billow and change shapes as they sweep across the winter sky. If you look closely, you may catch a glimpse of a flagship.</span><br>

<span style=""color:#000000""><strong>Business, Civic Leader&rsquo;s Legacy Continues In Endowment For Forestry Students</strong>. While dedicating 20 years of his working life to the wholesale oil business, Clifford Lathen &rsquo;40 never forgot his roots in the forestry program in the College of Natural Resources. Clifford and his wife, Elsie &rsquo;40, left $500,000 in their wills for an endowment that benefits students seeking degrees in Forest Products and Forest Resources. The Clifford F. and Elsie E. Lathen Forestry Scholarship honors the legacy of these longtime Moscow, Idaho leaders. Cliff came to the University of Idaho in 1934. He worked summers for the U. S. Forest Service and for Hale Motors during the school year. After earning his bachelor&rsquo;s degree, he worked for Potlatch Lumber Mill in Potlatch as safety and personnel manager until he purchased a wholesale oil business in Moscow in 1946. He later developed Lathen Construction and Heavy Hauling. As a civic leader, he also served as a city councilman and in a host of philanthropic organizations. He died in 2004. Elsie taught in Potlatch after graduating from the College of Education, but soon joined Cliff in the oil business. She died in June 2013.

Dear Friends,<br>
<br>
Discovery is a part of any new job, and one area I&#39;ve learned about quickly is Vandal Athletics.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Athletics is one of the most visible activities at a university. Boosters and fans follow their teams with great excitement; yet critics often express concern about whether athletics has a place in the university. What many forget is that the student athlete experience and their success is the factor on which we should focus. And, that is why I&rsquo;ve been excited to see the success of so many Vandal athlete-scholars in the last two weeks, both in competition and in the classroom.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
On the field, the men&rsquo;s indoor track and field team captured the WAC championship and the women took third place. Our women&rsquo;s swim and dive team broke 13 school records and took eight events to earn <a href=""http://www.govandals.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=91496&SPID=10342&DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=17100&ATCLID=209424379"" target=""_blank"">second place</a> in the WAC championship. In fact, swimmer <a href=""http://www.govandals.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=91496&SPID=10342&DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=17100&ATCLID=209427500"" target=""_blank"">Jamie Sterbis</a> qualified for the NCAA national championship. Our team also secured the titles for best dive coach, best diver and best swimmer. And, the women&rsquo;s tennis team&rsquo;s latest win placed them<a href=""http://www.govandals.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=87244&SPID=10360&DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=17100&ATCLID=209426562"" target=""_blank""> 51st in the nation</a>.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Other honors have just come in for both the men and women&rsquo;s basketball teams. Women&rsquo;s coach <a href=""http://www.govandals.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=17100&ATCLID=209430290"" target=""_blank"">Jon Newlee</a> earned the WAC Coach of the Year Award, and junior <a href=""http://www.govandals.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=17100&ATCLID=209430290"" target=""_blank"">Stacey Barr </a>was named WAC Player of the Year.&nbsp; For the men, senior <a href=""http://www.govandals.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=17100&ATCLID=209429952"" target=""_blank"">Stephen Madison</a> earned first-team all-WAC honors and there&rsquo;s an indication the men&rsquo;s team is <a href=""http://www.govandals.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=17100&ATCLID=209430930"" target=""_blank"">beginning to peak</a>.&nbsp;As an athlete, one always wants to excel against great competition, and we see that our Vandals are doing that.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
As a fan, it&rsquo;s a delight to watch our teams excel. Unfortunately, I didn&rsquo;t arrive in time to see all these events, but I did see the women&rsquo;s basketball team take the <a href=""http://www.wacsports.com/SplashPage.dbml?SPLASH_AD_ID=1278780"" target=""_blank"">WAC season championship</a>. This week they&rsquo;ve taken their game to the courts in Las Vegas for the post-season tourney. Beating Chicago State 84-43 to earn a <a href=""http://www.govandals.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=87267&SPID=10366&DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=17100&ATCLID=209432747"" target=""_blank"">place in the semi-finals</a>. They&rsquo;ll <a href=""http://www.govandals.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=87267&SPID=10366&DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=17100&ATCLID=209430290"" target=""_blank"">play again today at noon PST</a>,&nbsp;and we hope their wins will again take them the to NCAA tournament. The men&#39;s team has <a href=""http://www.govandals.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=87265&SPID=10365&DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=17100&ATCLID=209433611"" target=""_blank"">also moved into the semi-finals</a> with a 73-70 win over Kansas City. The men will <a href=""http://www.wacsports.com/SplashPage.dbml?SPLASH_AD_ID=1278780"" target=""_blank"">play today at 6 p.m. PST</a>. I hope you will join me in cheering both teams on, even at a distance.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
On the academic side, the team has already secured one national ranking.

Previously she earned three Academic All-WAC nods and national third team honors as a sophomore. She&rsquo;s just one of our many exceptional athlete-scholars. Runner Hannah Kiser was also recently named as a Capital One Academic All-America honoree -- her second such award.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Vandal scholarship athletes, as is true of Division I athletes in general, graduate at a higher rate than non-athletes and have higher GPAs. Athletics also plays an important part in our mission to develop the whole person for future success. Most athletes learn to successfully juggle the demands of athletics and academics. Kudos to the many students, athletes and non-athletes, who juggle multiple demands and succeed.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Go get &lsquo;em Vandals!<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>

<strong>&#39;Big-STEM&#39; Computer Among Tops In Nation.</strong> When Big-STEM goes fully online this summer, it will be one of the most powerful computers of its kind in the United States thanks to grants from the National Science Foundation and Murdock Charitable Trust. Big-STEM&rsquo;s power lies in its incredible amount of memory. When it&rsquo;s complete, Big-STEM will have eight terabytes of memory -- 4,000 times the memory of the average home computer. While other types of supercomputers can handle huge amounts of data, Big-STEM&rsquo;s big memory allows it to address problems that involve massive interactions among data, such as detailed simulations and models of complicated systems. <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/newsevents/item?name=ui-researchers-gain-new-advantage-with-one-of-the-nations-most-powerful-computers""><strong>Read more.</strong></a><br>

&nbsp;<br>
I&rsquo;ve spent much of this week in Washington D.C. meeting with Vandals and friends as well as government leaders. It was great to meet with so many enthusiastic friends in both formal and informal settings. I was warmly received into the Vandal family, just as I have experienced here in Idaho. Members of Idaho&rsquo;s congressional delegation and their staffs also shared their enthusiasm for helping us position the University of Idaho for greater success on the national scale.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
One of the most passionate groups gathered in D.C. as a show of support for Operation Education, a program created by Vandals to help meet the unique needs of wounded veterans when they return as students. We were able to thank some of them as well as recognize the work of Operation Education Advisory Council Honorary Co-chair Bonnie Amos -- wife of UI alum Gen. James Amos &rsquo;70, Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps. I&rsquo;m excited to report that my wife Mary Beth has agreed to serve as the other honorary co-chair with Bonnie.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Operation Education and our other services for veterans have resulted in the U of I&rsquo;s recognition as being among the nation&rsquo;s top 50 veteran-friendly U.S. campuses. One of the best ways that our University can thank our veterans for their service is by offering them support as they pursue their educations. This recognition is due to the efforts of our faculty and staff as well as many donors and volunteers.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
This is the embodiment of a deeper commitment to others that I&rsquo;ve seen in Vandals. When Mary Beth and I visited the Amos Veterans&#39; Center last week in Moscow, we could sense that, if our son or daughter were a veteran, we would be confident that Dan Button and Scott Oplinger would treat them as we would want them to be treated. And, we have found in our first weeks here that this level of care extends to many other groups on campus.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
That&rsquo;s why we continue to see more than one third of our freshman coming from families without a college graduate. That&rsquo;s why we continue to see an increase in our minority and international students. That&rsquo;s why our students in general stay and graduate in remarkable numbers. We strive to treat others as one would want a son or daughter, a family member or friend to be treated. That philosophy makes the University a great place to be a student and to work.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Go Vandals!<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Sincerely,<br>
&nbsp;<br>

Idaho needs the facility to be competitive with other golf programs in the northwest.&rdquo; University of Idaho Athletic Director Rob Spear has worked closely with the Halls on the project. &ldquo;Because of the generosity of Jess and Kathleen, our golf programs will have the luxury to practice year round,&rdquo; Spear said. The Halls know how to deal with adverse weather as they&rsquo;ve been building homes in Alaska for the last 35 years through their business, Hall Quality Homes. Jess is a native of Moscow and was excited for the opportunity to make a difference. &ldquo;We are grateful to the Halls for their generous gift,&rdquo; said Lisa Johnson, head women&rsquo;s golf coach. &ldquo;Their contribution will greatly impact our recruiting and training and help build a successful future for Vandal Golf.&rdquo; For more on giving to Vandal Athletics, contact Ryan Gerulf at (208) 364-4566 or ryang@uidaho.edu.<br>

<p>Great events are in store: receptions, a fun run, classes, entertainment <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/alumni/sarb/momsweekend"" target=""_blank"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"">and more</a>, as a way to say thank you and welcome to the university where they&rsquo;ve entrusted their children.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m excited to meet many of the moms and their children; I&rsquo;m also happy to say that there&rsquo;s one mom very special to me who will be participating: my wife, Mary Beth. I hope that you will have the chance to meet her. This is our first Mom&rsquo;s Weekend, and we are looking forward to participating in many of the events!</p>

<p>As a residential community, we provide unique opportunities for students to learn, to engage in research, to serve, and to lead. These experiences produce well-rounded students with a world-class education. Students who will be great citizens and leaders, in Idaho and beyond. But for most students, succeeding in college would not be possible without the commitment of moms and dads, and often many other family members and friends.</p>

<p>For <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/125years"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">125 years</a>, young men and women have left here as leaders, prepared to make a difference in a challenging world because of the quality education they&rsquo;ve received that helped shape what their families had already developed in them.</p>

<p>These successes come from a team effort at home and on campus. The support of great parents and extended family combined with our caring faculty, staff, fellow students, and friends provide the environment that crafts citizens from students. Because of the preparation at home and nurturing on campus, I&rsquo;m proud to report that nearly 60 percent of our first-time, full-time freshmen will graduate within six years. And that&rsquo;s phenomenal!</p>

<p>That teamwork also helps explain why we&rsquo;ve been ranked by <em>Washington Monthly</em> as 65th in the nation among universities that are the best in providing our graduates social mobility. Combine that with our recent recognition by <em>Forbes Magazine</em> as the third most affordable national university in the United States, and this is the place for students to be.</p>

<p>But for this weekend, it&rsquo;s all about Vandal moms. So on behalf of the Vandal community, let me say, &ldquo;Thank you moms!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dear Friends,</p>
 


Many of our students have left for the summer, but our University community keeps working.&nbsp;<br><br>
Faculty and students dive into their research, whether in the laboratory, the library, or for many researchers, in fields and forests around the world. &nbsp;Faculty members also revamp their courses over the summer. The overhaul of our introductory science laboratories, thanks to a <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/newsevents/item?name=ui-receives-12-million-to-bring-new-life-to-undergraduate-research-labs&utm_source=6614&utm_medium=email&utm_content=trish-hartzell-grant&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" target=""_blank"">$1.2 million grant from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute to Professor Trish Hartzell</a>, is a great example.<br>
<br>
Of course our students will travel abroad, take classes, or hold summer jobs and internships around Idaho and across the world. In the meantime, staff members are working hard to wrap up projects, like the fiscal year end, while supporting summer activities, and preparing for the fall term start up.<br>
<br>
Our facilities crew will be working on two major projects and many smaller ones, including one that may have special interest for generations of students. Our <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/ed/news-and-information/education-building-renovation-project?utm_source=6614&utm_medium=email&utm_content=ed-renovation&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" target=""_blank"">College of Education building</a>, originally built in 1968, will be stripped to the studs for a complete renovation, funded in part by the generosity of donors. It will reopen in 2016.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
We also plan to open the new <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/inspire/ways/iric?utm_source=6614&utm_medium=email&utm_content=iric&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" target=""_blank"">Integrated Research Innovation Center Building</a> in 2016. It will provide 45,000 square feet of interdisciplinary research space. We&rsquo;ll also renovate the largest lecture hall on campus &mdash; Life Sciences 277 &mdash; where many of you may have spent some time. We plan to post pictures of the graffiti that has accumulated over the last 46 years; you will be able to look for your own &ldquo;mark&rdquo; on a website in the future.<br>
<br>
My first summer as president will be busy too. I am sure that I will see many Friday Letter readers as I travel across the state: UI employees, students, and alumni as well as community, political, and business leaders. I look forward to meeting more Vandals and friends as I continue to listen and learn across the state.<br>
<br>
More specifically, I&rsquo;m seeking input into the processes and partnerships that help make the University of Idaho a success. I want to hear from others about what they know and what they see for the future of this university. If I don&rsquo;t get to visit you this summer, I&rsquo;d still like to hear from you. Please <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/president/contact?utm_source=6614&utm_medium=email&utm_content=feedback-to-president&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" target=""_blank"">share your thoughts about priorities and improvements here</a>.<br>
<br>
Starting in June, I&rsquo;ll tour the old Ada County Courthouse with state legislators. &nbsp;This building is slated to become the new home for the <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/law/newsandevents/features/programfeatures/state-law-library?utm_source=6614&utm_medium=email&utm_content=state-law-library&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" target=""_blank"">Boise branch of our College of Law</a>; next I&rsquo;ll head to the <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/aquaculture/facilities/hagermanstation?utm_source=6614&utm_medium=email&utm_content=hagerman&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" target=""_blank"">Aquaculture Research Institute in Hagerman</a>. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll also visit extension and research centers, dairies, and ranches in southern Idaho, including the <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/cnr/taylor?utm_source=6614&utm_medium=email&utm_content=taylor&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" target=""_blank"">Taylor Wilderness Research Station</a>. I&rsquo;ll spend some time in the Twin Falls and Idaho Falls areas before heading north to visit Coeur d&rsquo;Alene and Sandpoint.<br>
<br>
In early August, I&rsquo;ll return to the Magic Valley to join a portion of the <a href=""http://bit.ly/1nmCsAA"" target=""_blank"">400-mile &ldquo;Ride Idaho&rdquo; event</a> where I&rsquo;ll bike across some of the most beautiful country in the state. &nbsp;I&#39;ll be sporting Vandal gear while riding with Guillermo Ordorica, the new Mexican consul in Boise, who plans to join me in this adventure. I hope some of you will also join us.<br>
<br>
Summer won&rsquo;t be all travel; however, the University community will plunge into recruiting students with the help of a new enrollment management consulting director, and we will finalize our plan to bolster distance education efforts. Sprinkle in some research development activities, some fundraising, and the normal rhythm of serving as president and it is a pretty good recipe for a productive and educational summer.<br>
<br>
In a sense, I am like any freshman &mdash; enjoying the new opportunities and challenges of coming to the University.<br>
<br>
Have a great summer, and I hope that our paths will cross soon!<br><br>

<p>Dear Friends,</p>
 


Summer is a great time to be outdoors in Idaho, enjoying the natural beauty, but also participating in a healthy lifestyle. And, as I mentioned in my previous letter, it’s been a great time to travel around our state, observing the impact that the University has in every region.<br><br>

An extraordinary example of fitness was the recent IRONMAN Coeur d’Alene triathlon. A large number of Vandals completed the grueling triathlon while 50 Vandal volunteers, organized by Andrea Barlow, helped with the event, which was sponsored in part by the university. All the volunteers, including Mary Beth and I, admired the tenacity of these contestants.<br>
<br>
Handing out electrolytes at a race of this caliber is exciting, but the University engages in  more fundamental roles in helping Idaho residents eat smarter and exercise more. For example, our Eat Smart Idaho and Healthy Living programs reach across the state through UI Extension. Our <a href=""http://bit.ly/1oIm3G1"">Healthy Living program</a> builds on two U.S. Department of Agriculture initiatives that began in the late 1970s. Our efforts, led by Paul McCauley and Kristen Hansen, focus on helping those with low incomes make wise nutritional and physical activity choices for the healthiest results.<br>
<br>
Currently, 27 nutrition advisors work in 38 Idaho counties to benefit more than 20,000 Idahoans each year. A 2012 study showed 25 percent to 50 percent of participants adopted healthier diets, including eating more fruit and fresh vegetables. College of Agricultural and Life Sciences advisors have also assisted food pantry organizations that help those in need to make ends meet. <br>
<br>
Thanks to a grant from the National 4-H Council in conjunction with Con-Agra Corporation, our 4-H team led by Maureen Toomey joined in a <a href=""http://bit.ly/1ncDN9U"">related effort</a> with the Healthy Living program in collaboration with Eat Smart Idaho.<br>
<br>
The 4-H Food Smart Families effort delivers a healthy living program to students in first through twelfth grades. Over the summer, nearly 2,500 students in 19 counties will be led through 10 sessions including nutrition basics and meal preparation, which culminate in both a community service event, and a family meal in which they share what they’ve learned. <br>
<br>
Twenty-one teen advocates support 10 college interns and 27 nutrition advisors who lead these classes. Several of those volunteers shared their enthusiasm for the program at the 4-H Teen Conference in Moscow recently. Other community partners extend the reach and success of these efforts: summer migrant education programs in Canyon and Owyhee counties, Boys and Girls Clubs of Twin Falls and Ada counties, the Caldwell YMCA, Parks and Recreation Departments in Boise and Emmett, St. Luke’s Hospital in Donnelley, Coeur d’Alene 4 Kids, and other school and community organizations across the state.<br>
<br>
“Our partners are essential to success,” said Maureen Toomey, Healthy Living coordinator. “Once the students get a chance to work with the food they really get excited about it. It’s amazing how well they respond.”<br>
<br>
The UI and its partners are providing vital life skills to participants. Better nutrition and better health lead to lifelong improvements in life quality and in productivity as well as reductions in medical costs. Additionally, some program participants have used their experience to gain new jobs.<br>
<br>
It’s all part of serving Idaho and its citizens &mdash; it’s about making a hand off that contributes to success.<br><br>

<p>Sincerely,</p>
 
<em><strong>Chuck Staben</strong></em><br>
President<br><br>
P.S.  Next month, I’ll join in another challenge by biking a portion of the 400-mile <a href=""http://bit.ly/1nmCsAA"">“Ride Idaho” event</a> with Guillermo Ordorica, the new Mexican consul in Boise. I hope some of you will join us.

<p>Dear Friends,</p>
 
Day by day, activity on campus has increased exponentially! A new academic year begins today as nearly 12,000 graduate and undergraduate students &mdash; representing 50 states (plus Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, District of Columbia, American Samoa) and 71 foreign countries &mdash; and more than 2,400 faculty and staff make final preparations for the start of the 2014-15 Academic Year on Monday.<br>
<br>
There’s a symbolic rebirth each year as the faculty and staff welcome back our students. We all  come together to dedicate a new year to learning and growth with the ultimate aim of helping students find fulfilling careers and lead better lives. More than 80 new faculty members will join in that welcome as they enter a university community committed to the future. That commitment is realized through our research, outreach, and instruction &mdash; with daily opportunities for our students to engage in this important work.<br>
<br>
Although the start of a new academic year may be most obvious in Moscow, students and faculty also return to our centers in <span style=""color:#b18e5f; text-decoration:none;""><a style=""color:#b18e5f; text-decoration:none;"" href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/cda?utm_source=82114&utm_medium=email&utm_content=cda&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" target=""_blank"">Coeur d’Alene</a></span>, <span style=""color:#b18e5f; text-decoration:none;""><a style=""color:#b18e5f;"" href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/boise?utm_source=82114&utm_medium=email&utm_content=boise&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" target=""_blank"">Boise</a></span>, and <span style=""color:#b18e5f; text-decoration:none;""><a style=""color:#b18e5f;"" href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/idahofalls?utm_source=82114&utm_medium=email&utm_content=idahofalls&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" target=""_blank"">Idaho Falls</a></span>. And, as I have described in past letters, our activities never really stop, with <span style=""color:#b18e5f; text-decoration:none;""><a style=""color:#b18e5f;"" href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/research?utm_source=82114&utm_medium=email&utm_content=research&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" target=""_blank"">very active research</a></span> on the Moscow campus and at dozens of statewide research sites and stations operating on a 12-month calendar.  <br>
<br>
Here in Moscow, students have been moving into residence halls, Greek houses, and apartments. The air is filled with marching tunes as the <span style=""color:#b18e5f; text-decoration:none;""><a style=""color:#b18e5f;"" href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/class/music/ensembles/marching-band?utm_source=82114&utm_medium=email&utm_content=marching-band&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" target=""_blank"">Sound of Idaho marching band</a></span> practices. Athletes toil in the heat while other students relax in the shade. Meanwhile, excited freshmen and transfer students learn their way around campus.<br>
<br>
Today, we’ll formally launch the academic year with the traditional convocation ceremony that invites the community to come together in anticipation of the work of discovery and learning that lies ahead.  <br>
<br>
This year, our keynote speaker is <span style=""color:#b18e5f; text-decoration:none;""><a style=""color:#b18e5f;"" href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/president/University-Convocation/speaker-bio?utm_source=82114&utm_medium=email&utm_content=sean-astin&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" target=""_blank"">actor Sean Astin</a></span> of Lord of the Rings fame (some may also remember his mother, Patty Duke Astin from The Patty Duke Show of my childhood). You are welcome to join us in the Kibbie Dome or via webcast at <span style=""color:#b18e5f; text-decoration:none;""><a style=""color:#b18e5f;"" href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/newsevents/uidaholive?utm_source=82114&utm_medium=email&utm_content=uidaho-live&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" target=""_blank"">www.uidaho.edu/live</a></span> beginning at 8:30 a.m. (Pacific Time). Campus-wide events will follow as students connect with new friends and classmates as well as faculty, staff, and community members in club, intramural, and other group events.<br>
<br>
In truth, I am as excited as many of our students, since today begins my first full academic year! Yesterday, Mary Beth and I helped some families move their students in. I’ve also met with student government, Faculty Senate, and Staff Council leaders to make plans for working together this year.  My first six months at Idaho have been very informative; you will hear me speak many times about what we can all do to make our extraordinary university even better. Please continue to share your ideas with me.<br>
<br>
The fall schedule will be full, but also offers many opportunities for fun. Mary Beth and I are looking forward to seeing many of you at <span style=""color:#b18e5f; text-decoration:none;""><a style=""color:#b18e5f;"" href=""http://www.govandals.com/SportSelect.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=17100&SPID=10352"" target=""_blank"">football games</a></span> and <span style=""color:#b18e5f;""><a style=""color:#b18e5f;"" href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/calendar?utm_source=82114&utm_medium=email&utm_content=calendar&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" target=""_blank"">campus events</a></span>, or perhaps on the bike trail. We are excited about being part of the Vandal experience that so many of you treasure.<br>
<br>
I applaud our new students and faculty for joining the Vandal community. At <span style=""color:#b18e5f; text-decoration:none;""><a style=""color:#b18e5f;"" href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/president/University-Convocation?utm_source=82114&utm_medium=email&utm_content=convocation&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" target=""_blank"">Convocation</a></span> and throughout the year, I will encourage students to take advantage of the many opportunities for personal growth and learning available to them. Study hard. Play smart. Stay healthy. Let’s prepare for an exciting future!<br><br>

Dear Friends,<br>
<br>
Imagine a football coach rounding up his team on the first day of practice and telling them they won&rsquo;t be lifting weights or running this year. No prepping plays. No reviewing their opponents&rsquo; tactics. Just show up a few minutes early to the first game, and you&rsquo;ll play fine!<br>
<br>
I know this is not the approach Coach Petrino is taking with the Vandals for <a href=""http://www.govandals.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=17100&ATCLID=209620088"" target=""_blank"">tomorrow&rsquo;s opening game</a> against Florida &mdash; nor is it the approach we&rsquo;d expect anyone who seeks success to take.<br>
<br>
So how do students ensure victory in their college endeavors? Like athletes, they should plan, practice and review. When I was teaching biology courses, I shared this analogy with my students. Their exams were the games, their practice tests scrimmages, their homework and classes their daily workouts. All the elements had to be in line to succeed. The same process of preparation applies not just to athletics but also to any showcase of skill, whether a piano recital, an art show or a scientific experiment.<br>
<br>
At <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/president/University-Convocation/Convocation-in-Review/convocation-2014-sean-astin?utm_source=82914&utm_medium=email&utm_content=convocation&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" target=""_blank"">Convocation</a> last week, I extended this same analogy to our incoming class of University of Idaho students. We welcomed them to campus with events like <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/studentaffairs/department-of-student-involvement/center-for-volunteerism-and-social-action/get-involved/service/sync?utm_source=82914&utm_medium=email&utm_content=sync&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" target=""_blank"">SYNC</a> (Serving Your New Community), <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/studentaffairs/department-of-student-involvement/initiatives/summer-programs/palousafest?utm_source=82914&utm_medium=email&utm_content=palousafest&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" target=""_blank"">Palousafest</a>, and the Vandal Walk to help them feel at home and connect with other Vandals. But this week they dove into their primary role as students.<br>
<br>
We set the bar high at the University of Idaho, to use another sports metaphor, but we will help students clear that bar. And we expect each student we admit to succeed.<br>
<br>
Our faculty and staff are coaches who teach them the skills they need to face the challenges ahead. &nbsp;Faculty and staff also provide the playbook to students so they aren&rsquo;t walking onto the field without a plan. Students&rsquo; peers in their classes, clubs and living groups are teammates with whom they can practice and find inspiring camaraderie. Resources across campus &ndash; such as <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/studentaffairs/asap?utm_source=82914&utm_medium=email&utm_content=asap&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" target=""_blank"">Academic Support and Access Services</a> and the <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/CTC?utm_source=82914&utm_medium=email&utm_content=ctc&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" target=""_blank"">Counseling and Testing Center</a> &mdash; are like trainers who can provide a bit of help to students when, or even before, they need it.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
And you &mdash; our alumni, the university&rsquo;s many friends and our students&rsquo; family members &mdash; are the crowd cheering them on.<br>
<br>
Walking across campus these first few days of the new academic year, I can feel the spirit of excitement among our &ldquo;team,&rdquo; and I&rsquo;m excited for them. Students&rsquo; dedicated practice and performance during their years as University of Idaho students will pay off for them in life as they move up to the big leagues and become leaders and innovators in our state, nation and world.<br><br>
As always at the University of Idaho – Go Vandals!<br><br>

                   The roots of Lola Gamble Clyde’s family tree are deeply entwined with the University of Idaho. After earning her education degree from the UI in 1927, Lola became a beloved teacher at a one-room schoolhouse in rural Latah County. The Vandal legacy grew as Lola’s children &mdash; Robert Clyde ’57, Isabel Bond ’54, Erlene Soulen ’53, and Mary Sullivan ’51 &mdash; as well as 14 grandchildren and multiple great-grandchildren all became U-Idaho alumni.<br><br>
While many of the family members have individually donated to U-Idaho, the family recently banded together to memorialize Lola. Her grandchildren pledged $50,000 to establish the Lola Clyde Classroom as part of the College of Education building renovation project. The classroom will honor Idaho’s pioneer teachers who, like Lola, established the teaching profession in one-room schoolhouses.<br><br>

<br>
The University of Idaho provides abundant opportunities for students to shine. Some stand out in academics, earning awards for their classwork and promoting their fields of study through <span style=""color:#b18e5f; text-decoration:none""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/studentaffairs/department-of-student-involvement/student-orgs?utm_source=9514&utm_medium=email&utm_content=student-orgs&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" style=""color:#b18e5f; text-decoration:none;"" target=""_blank"">clubs and honor societies</a></span>. Some excel in service, participating in <span style=""color:#b18e5f; text-decoration:none""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/studentaffairs/department-of-student-involvement/center-for-volunteerism-and-social-action/alternative-service-breaks?utm_source=9514&utm_medium=email&utm_content=alternative-service-breaks&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" style=""color:#b18e5f; text-decoration:none;"" target=""_blank"">Alternative Service Breaks</a></span> or volunteering with campus and community organizations. Others find their niches in the arts, athletics, or living-group activities. Many students lead.<br>
<br>
A few among our student body rise to lead their peers in student government. For generations, presidents of the <span style=""color:#b18e5f; text-decoration:none""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/studentaffairs/department-of-student-involvement/asui?utm_source=9514&utm_medium=email&utm_content=asui&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" style=""color:#b18e5f; text-decoration:none;"" target=""_blank"">Associated Students of the University of Idaho</a></span> (ASUI), <span style=""color:#b18e5f; text-decoration:none""><a href=""http://bit.ly/Z8YAHr"" style=""color:#b18e5f; text-decoration:none;"" target=""_blank"">Graduate and Professional Student Association</a></span> (GPSA) and the <span style=""color:#b18e5f; text-decoration:none""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/law/academics/clinicsprofessionalskills/leadershipopportunities?utm_source=9514&utm_medium=email&utm_content=student-bar-asso&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" style=""color:#b18e5f; text-decoration:none;"" target=""_blank"">Student Bar Association</a></span> have honed their leadership skills while encouraging and inspiring their fellow students.<br>
<br>
Our current student leaders &mdash; Nate Fisher of ASUI, Anthony St. Clair of GPSA, and Nii-Amaa Ollennu of the Student Bar &mdash; are smart, gracious and professional young men who are eager to serve in the coming year. Today, please take the opportunity to meet Fisher in the interview below and gain insight into the mind of a student leader.<br>
<br>
But first, I&rsquo;d like to reflect on the role of ASUI President. For 110 years of the University&rsquo;s <span style=""color:#b18e5f; text-decoration:none""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/125years?utm_source=9514&utm_medium=email&utm_content=125-site&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" style=""color:#b18e5f; text-decoration:none;"" target=""_blank"">125-year history</a></span>, ASUI presidents have supported student activities and represented the student voice.<br>
<br>
From the students of 1904 who formed ASUI to help each student feel &ldquo;directly concerned with all of the student enterprises,&rdquo; to modern-day presidents like Samantha Perez-Parrott (2011-12) who worked to institute accountability processes for student fees, ASUI presidents have helped their peers come together as a student body to improve their lives and their university.<br>
<br>
New leaders in our local communities, state, and nation have emerged from among this group. On the national political scene, 1974-75 ASUI President Dirk Kempthorne &mdash; an Idaho Senator and Governor, as well as U.S. Secretary of the Interior &mdash; and 1968-69 ASUI President Larry Craig &mdash; an Idaho Representative and Senator &mdash; rose to prominence. Mr. Kempthorne recently worked with UI and the state to celebrate the Snake River Basin Adjudication, a landmark water rights decision. (View <span style=""color:#b18e5f; text-decoration:none""><a href=""http://bit.ly/1qrT78S"" style=""color:#b18e5f; text-decoration:none;"" target=""_blank"">this video</a></span> to learn more.)<br>
<br>
ASUI presidents of more recent years include Mahmood Sheikh (1998-99), now deputy executive director of the Idaho State Bar; Autumn Hansen (2004-05), now a social worker at Riley Hospital for Children in Indiana; and Hannah Davis (2012-13), currently serving with Teach for America as a sixth-grade social studies teacher in Texas. Samantha Parrott, mentioned earlier, works for the Humane Society of Idaho.<br>
<br>
Other former ASUI presidents have succeeded in politics, business, academics and service. I have no doubt that Nate Fisher will someday rank among them &mdash; as will the many Vandals who take on campus leadership in its various forms.<br>
<br>
There is only one ASUI President each year, but we see student leaders on our athletic teams, in our residence halls, in Greek life, and in our classrooms and laboratories. We know that we will see all these Vandals succeed as leaders in our state and in our society.</span>

He will serve as ASUI President for the 2014-15 school year, and he got his start in student government in junior high school. His parents, Jean Fisher and Nathan Fisher Sr., are both UI alumni, and he credits the many alumni he knows with convincing him UI was the best choice for his education.</em><br>
<br>
<em>Why did you decide to pursue student leadership?</em><br>
As long as I can remember, I always liked being involved. I think that being involved creates a lot stronger ties to my peers, to faculty, staff and administration, and to the school. &nbsp;The student voice is necessary &ndash; we are the primary stakeholders in the university, and we deserve to have a voice. I&rsquo;ve enjoyed being able to express that.<br>
<br>
<em>What are your goals and priorities for your time as ASUI President? </em><br>
The ASUI president is really charged with being the spokesman for the undergraduate student population. A very large portion of my job responsibility is being able to communicate effectively with other stakeholders.<br>
<br>
One of my major priorities is getting an Idaho Student Association up and running statewide. Also, I want a &ldquo;student space&rdquo; on campus. When I look around campus, I really don&rsquo;t see a lot of space for students to come together and just lounge and relax. And I know lots of other issues will come up &ndash; things you can&rsquo;t predict, but you have to react to.<br>
<br>
<em>Have you been inspired by past ASUI Presidents?</em><br>
Everyone has great advice. There&rsquo;s a steep learning curve, so being able to talk to past presidents was beneficial. They all had advice about who to meet, places to be and how to prioritize things you&rsquo;re working on throughout the year. ASUI presidents are a cool class of people, and they all did important things while they were here.<br>
<br>
<em>How does your role as ASUI President prepare you for the future?</em><br>
I&rsquo;ve heard a lot about former ASUI presidents being very successful, particularly in the state of Idaho and Idaho politics. I think that&rsquo;s the trajectory I&rsquo;d like to take. I&rsquo;ve always envisioned a career in public policy, and I think this positon is equipping me well for that goal.<br>
<br>
I think being an effective communicator is one of my strongest leadership skills, but I&rsquo;ve already learned a great deal more in my first couple months. I&rsquo;m a firm believer that politics is all about relationships, so it&rsquo;s important to maintain those relationships and also be effective in establishing your priorities and be able to get things done.</td>

            <span style=""margin:0px; padding:0px;"">Dear Friends,<br>
<br>
Among the many activities with which we welcome students to the University of Idaho, an event coming up next week stands out as particularly important.<br>
<br>
<span style=""color:#b18e5f; text-decoration:none""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/studentaffairs/health-education/i-got-your-back/campus-safety-programs?utm_source=91214&utm_medium=email&utm_content=safety-programs&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" style=""color:#b18e5f; text-decoration:none;"" target=""_blank"">&ldquo;I Got Your Back&rdquo; Campus Safety Week</a></span> begins Monday. This is my first opportunity to attend this annual event, and I look forward to it with interest and a sense of urgency.<br>
<br>
The keynote event of this year&rsquo;s Campus Safety Week is a presentation by Dr. Keith Edwards, the founder of <span style=""color:#b18e5f; text-decoration:none""><a href=""http://bit.ly/1tOyHJF"" style=""color:#b18e5f; text-decoration:none;"" target=""_blank"">Men Ending Rape</a></span>, who will challenge Vandal men to actively work toward ending campus rape and encourage all our students, staff and faculty to stand together as we confront this societal issue.<br>
<br>
This is a topic of particular importance to me. Last year, I was challenged and inspired by educator <span style=""color:#b18e5f; text-decoration:none""><a href=""http://bit.ly/YC44uo"" style=""color:#b18e5f; text-decoration:none;"" target=""_blank"">Jackson Katz&rsquo; TED Talk</a></span>, which frames violence against women, children and other men as a men&rsquo;s issue &mdash; something all men must address, but particularly those in leadership positions. Katz specifically called out university presidents as people who can set priorities at their institutions and educate the young people they influence.<br>
<br>
In a recent Friday Letter I wrote that the university sets the bar high for our students academically. We set it high for them behaviorally as well.<br>
<br>
I want every student at the University of Idaho, but especially those who identify themselves as men, to consider and discuss what it means to be a &ldquo;good man.&rdquo; Then, I want them to reach for those ideals.<br>
<br>
I believe good men must think carefully about their behaviors and the effects they have on those around them. Part of the university experience is learning to exercise values such as integrity, compassion and personal responsibility.<br>
<br>
Students also must take responsibility for each other, caring for each other and directing each other to better paths when the need arises. The slogan &ldquo;I Got Your Back&rdquo; reminds students that every Vandal is part of a community, and programs like <span style=""color:#b18e5f; text-decoration:none""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/DOS/vpp/programsandservices/green-dot?utm_source=91214&utm_medium=email&utm_content=vandals-green-dot&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" style=""color:#b18e5f; text-decoration:none;"" target=""_blank"">Vandal Green Dot</a></span> call on all Vandals to make health and safety a community responsibility.<br>
<br>
The University of Idaho offers students help in achieving these goals. In recent years, the university has implemented a number of new programs and bolstered ongoing programs to help students place a high value on physical, mental and emotional safety and wellbeing, both for themselves and for others.<br>
<br>
Every new student must complete the <span style=""color:#b18e5f; text-decoration:none""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/studentaffairs/orientation/think-about-it?utm_source=91214&utm_medium=email&utm_content=think-about-it&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" style=""color:#b18e5f; text-decoration:none;"" target=""_blank"">&ldquo;Think About It&rdquo;</a></span> online safety course and participate in a safety seminar during orientation. All new fraternity and sorority members participate in a Greek-specific safety program. We&rsquo;ve recently begun offering <span style=""color:#b18e5f; text-decoration:none""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/ctc/for-students/mental-health-resources/mental-health-first-aid?utm_source=91214&utm_medium=email&utm_content=mental-firstaid&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" style=""color:#b18e5f; text-decoration:none;"" target=""_blank"">Mental Health First Aid training</a></span>, <span style=""color:#b18e5f; text-decoration:none""><a href=""http://bit.ly/X4B39d"" style=""color:#b18e5f; text-decoration:none;"" target=""_blank"">established a suicide prevention program</a></span> and <span style=""color:#b18e5f; text-decoration:none""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/studentaffairs/health-education/alcohol-and-drugs/alcohol?utm_source=91214&utm_medium=email&utm_content=alcohol&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" style=""color:#b18e5f; text-decoration:none;"" target=""_blank"">expanded alcohol education programs</a></span>. We require Green Dot training for student athletes and other campus leaders so they can serve as role models for their peers.<br>
<br>
Campus Safety Week opens the door for every person at the University of Idaho to learn about and engage with the university&rsquo;s programs and resources that seek to end violence, abuse, and risky behaviors. I encourage all of you who will be on campus next week to take advantage of this opportunity. The <span style=""color:#b18e5f; text-decoration:none""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/studentaffairs/health-education/i-got-your-back/campus-safety-programs?utm_source=91214&utm_medium=email&utm_content=campus-safety&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" style=""color:#b18e5f; text-decoration:none;"" target=""_blank"">Campus Safety Week website</a></span> is also a great resource for those of you located outside of Moscow &mdash; please check it out to learn more.</span>

Murdock Charitable Trust continues their longtime support of UI&rsquo;s research programs by recently funding two scientific equipment purchases totaling over $380,000. The &ldquo;Big-STEM&rdquo; computer is one of the most powerful computers of its kind in the United States. &ldquo;Basically, Big-STEM means we are solving problems that pretty much no one else is working on,&rdquo; says computer science professor Jim Alves-Foss.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
A second award assisted with the purchase of a dynamic imaging system. &ldquo;Whether studying a disease process in virology or the transfer of plasmids in a growing colony of microorganisms, the dynamic imaging system will not just tell us what happens over time, but when, how and where it happened,&rdquo; says biology professor Deborah Stenkamp. Over the past three decades, Murdock has provided more than $5 million for research equipment at the University of Idaho.

            <span style=""margin:0px; padding:0px;"">Dear Friends,<br>
<br>
This afternoon, I&rsquo;ll walk into the Kibbie Dome and join the Vandal community as we celebrate my <span style=""color:#b18e5f; text-decoration:none""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/president/presidential-inauguration"" style=""color:#b18e5f; text-decoration:none;"" target=""_blank"">inauguration</a></span>. This is a big occasion for me, certainly, but the day is truly about all the people who work together to make the University of Idaho successful.<br>
<br>
As the 18<sup>th</sup> president of the university, I join a long and storied history of people who have dedicated their intellect, talent and energy to educating students and improving the lives of Idahoans. We&rsquo;ve scheduled the inauguration for 1:25 p.m. to recognize that <span style=""color:#b18e5f; text-decoration:none""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/125years"" style=""color:#b18e5f; text-decoration:none;"" target=""_blank"">125-year history</a></span>.<br>
<br>
But in my speech today, I&rsquo;ll be looking forward. The message is titled &ldquo;Keys to Our Future,&rdquo; and I believe every student, staff member, faculty member, alumni and friend of the University of Idaho holds those keys. Our future excellence is under our control.<br>
<br>
My friend and mentor Lee Todd, former president of the University of Kentucky, will provide the keynote address this afternoon. Lee introduced me to higher-level administration years ago, when he named me chair of a committee tasked with finding strategies to position the University of Kentucky as a top-20 national research institution.<br>
<br>
It was no simple task. While there is no easy way to define what a &ldquo;top&rdquo; university is, we discovered there is great value in aiming to be the best you can be.<br>
<br>
I&rsquo;ve said many times in my first months as president that one of my broad goals for the University of Idaho is to see us become better &mdash; even better than we believed possible.<br>
<br>
My sons are avid swimmers, and I watched youth swimming for 15 years. Few 6-year-olds could swim even 25 yards of butterfly &mdash; it&rsquo;s a very difficult stroke. Yet, after 10 years of hard work, though few become Michael Phelps, every one could swim 200 yards. Each had become better than he or she could ever have believed. The University of Idaho can become better than we could ever believe.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
At the University of Idaho, we may not have the resources to skyrocket to the the top of national rankings lists, but we have the ability to do the absolute best we can with what we have, where we&rsquo;re at.<br>
<br>
As a land-grant university, one of our highest callings is the education of students. I believe we have the ability to provide an excellent and affordable education to more students from Idaho, the West and the world, so I&rsquo;ve made increasing enrollment my first mission as president.<br>
<br>
Every Vandal is part of that mission. Our faculty and researchers will teach and mentor these students. Our staff will keep the university ticking as we expand. Our students will welcome new peers into a strong and friendly community. Our alumni and friends will support new students with their generosity and Vandal spirit.<br>
<br>
As the University of Idaho grows and changes, we all play a role. <em>You</em> hold the keys to our future.</span>

<br>
John S. Townsend of Moses Lake, Wash., recently made a $100,000 gift to help purchase a new nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer for the Department of Chemistry. The NMR is a critical piece of equipment for research in the department. John studied chemistry at UI, worked for Idaho Potato Starch in Blackfoot, and then Western Polymer in Moses Lake. He later purchased Western Polymer, which produces starch for the paper industry and food-grade starch. John sold the company, which also has operations in Maine and North Dakota, to his children a few years ago, and his daughter now runs the business. &ldquo;My studies at Idaho prepared me for a career in chemistry, so I am making this gift in appreciation of the education I received,&rdquo; John said. For more information about giving to the College of Science, please contact Eric Bennett at (208) 885-9106 or <span style=""color:#b18e5f; text-decoration:none""><a href=""mailto:ebennett@uidaho.edu"" style=""color:#b18e5f; text-decoration:none;"" target=""_blank"">ebennett@uidaho.edu</a></span>.</td>

            <span style=""margin:0px; padding:0px;"">Dear Friends,<br>
<br>
This weekend, we honor three great contributors to the University of Idaho&rsquo;s past, present and future.<br>
<br>
First, we welcome our students&rsquo; parents with <a href=""http://bit.ly/1rv2mG7"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">Dads&#39; Weekend</a>. I&rsquo;m thankful for the fathers and families who support, encourage and challenge our students, and I hope they enjoy this opportunity to get a glimpse into their children&rsquo;s lives at the university.<br>
<br>
On Friday, we celebrate our supportive local community with the <a href=""http://on.fb.me/ZdRce0"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">Vandal Town Block Party</a>. This is a new event, sponsored by the City of Moscow and the Moscow Chamber of Commerce, designed to connect town and gown. Local businesses and bands will be on hand to welcome students to the community.<br>
<br>
Finally, this weekend includes <a href=""http://bit.ly/Y67AvN"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">Celebrating Idaho Agriculture</a> and <a href=""http://bit.ly/Y67Meq"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">Ag Days</a>. Agriculture has been central to the University of Idaho since our earliest years, and it remains the foundation of Idaho&rsquo;s economy today, generating $7.8 billion in sales in 2013. Our state feeds the world with potatoes, grain, beef, dairy products, trout and dozens of other products. The University of Idaho continues to provide the information and innovation that keep Idaho&rsquo;s agricultural industries strong and growing.<br>
<br>
<a href=""http://bit.ly/1mVGu6M"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">College of Agricultural and Life Sciences</a> researchers develop heartier grain varieties, fight potato pests, improve food production processes, and prepare growers for a changing climate and so much more. And we don&rsquo;t just generate knowledge, we gather and share it through a statewide network of 12 regional <a href=""http://bit.ly/1pdGwSF"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">research and extension</a> centers and 42 extension offices serving Idaho counties.<br>
<br>
In my first months as president, I&rsquo;ve been eager to talk to researchers and industry leaders about ways this work can grow broader and deeper. I have visited every one of our research and extension centers and enjoyed several field days. I&rsquo;ve met with agricultural commissions and associations and with leaders of the food industry in Idaho and nationally. As one result of such consultation, we&rsquo;re now investigating the potential for UI to create a research center focusing on dairy &mdash; a booming sector of Idaho&rsquo;s economy in which we can take a leadership role.<br>
<br>
We can&rsquo;t do this work alone. The university is proud to partner with industry leaders such as <a href=""http://bit.ly/ZdRotY"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">Limagrain Cereal Seeds</a>, commodities commissions like the <a href=""http://bit.ly/1u03bHu"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">Idaho Wheat Commission</a> and generous donors such as Genesee wheat farmers <a href=""http://bit.ly/1mVH7gx"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">Russ and Kathy Zenner</a> &mdash; and that&rsquo;s just one crop and one set of committed partners for whom we&rsquo;re grateful.<br>
<br>
As many of these partners visit Moscow this weekend, I hope our community takes the opportunity to learn more about Idaho agriculture&rsquo;s contributions and the role UI can play in its success.<br>
<br>
Celebrating Idaho Agriculture events include this afternoon&rsquo;s free panel discussion, &ldquo;<a href=""http://bit.ly/1v14Xsg"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">Feeding 9 Billion People: Technology&rsquo;s Impact,&rdquo;</a> at which top agricultural leaders will talk about how agriculture will use technology to feed the world&rsquo;s rapidly growing population.<br>
<br>
On Saturday before the <a href=""http://bit.ly/1rv2Yvq"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">Vandals take on South Alabama</a>, please meet Mary Beth and me at the Celebrating Idaho Agriculture Pregame Festival on the Kibbie Dome north lawn. (For details and other events, click <a href=""http://bit.ly/Y67AvN"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.)<br>
<br>
In addition to research, the University of Idaho provides another key resource to Idaho agriculture: the students who learn about agriculture here and take their knowledge to the state and the world. Their talent and skills are the true seeds of innovation.<br>
<br>
That&rsquo;s something future Vandals will soon discover, too. As hundreds of high school students from the Northwest visit Ag Days, our CALS faculty, staff, students and alumni will introduce them to the opportunities they have at UI and inspire them to study fields related to agriculture, foods and natural resources.<br>
<br>
We know that, in the future, some of those students will return to campus as alumni to celebrate Idaho agriculture again as farmers, ranchers, researchers, entrepreneurs and industry leaders. We&rsquo;ll be here, dedicated to helping this vital industry thrive.</span>

The commission, which represents wheat growers throughout the state, will support the Idaho wheat-breeding program by providing $604,000 toward a new university position targeting wheat genetics.<br>
<br>
The Idaho Wheat Genetics Program will focus on broad areas of basic wheat genetic research, including the development of technology and processes to support wheat research and development. A national search recently launched to fill this tenure-track position, which will have an 80 percent research and 20 percent teaching appointment.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;This new position will be at the forefront of efforts to focus new variety development on using new tools to identify and incorporate genetic traits, which will improve and accelerate the creation of new wheats tailored to grower and consumer needs,&rdquo; said Donn Thill, Idaho Agricultural Experiment Station director.<br>

            <span style=""margin:0px; padding:0px;"">Dear Friends,<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The strength of a university lies in the strength of its faculty. In my first 200 days as president, I&rsquo;ve been privileged to meet faculty members whose enthusiasm, positivity and intelligence make the University of Idaho strong.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The university&rsquo;s first mission is education, and excellent faculty members share their knowledge with their students and encourage them to challenge themselves beyond the classroom. Faculty members also lead the way in research and outreach, bringing new discoveries and understanding to today&rsquo;s most vital topics and extending those results to people who can benefit from them.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The University of Idaho is home to longtime professors like the Lionel Hampton School of Music&rsquo;s Dan Bukvich, a University Distinguished Professor, percussionist and composer whose recognitions include winning <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/newsevents/item?name=longtime-u-idaho-music-professor-receives-national-teaching-award&utm_source=10314&utm_medium=email&utm_content=professor-of-the-year&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">the 2012 U.S. Professor of the Year Award</a></span> for the state of Idaho. Bukvich came to UI in 1977 and has since inspired a love of musical performance in generations of Vandals with his passionate, exuberant and occasionally offbeat teaching style. Many of us have enjoyed listening to the Jazz Choir under his direction.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Alongside faculty who have dedicated years to the University of Idaho, many new faces bring fresh ideas and vibrancy to campus. This year, I&rsquo;m pleased to welcome faculty such as <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/research/research-articles-2014/rr-evolution?utm_source=10314&utm_medium=email&utm_content=marx&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">Chris Marx</a></span> in the College of Science and <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/research/research-articles-2014/rr-ruralcommunities?utm_source=10314&utm_medium=email&utm_content=alessa&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">Lil Alessa</a></span> in the College of Art and Architecture to the Vandal ranks.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Marx, an associate professor of biological sciences, came to UI from Harvard as the first among a new group of professors in physics, mathematics, statistics and biology who will work to bridge their disciplines. His innovative work includes developing mathematical models that can predict how bacteria might evolve, giving scientists new tools to respond to and guide bacterial evolution in ways that could benefit humanity. Dr. Marx also has founded a company to commercialize some of the work in his lab on converting methane to dietary protein using bacteria, a technology that seems far-fetched until one considers the reduced price of natural gas due to enhanced recovery.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Alessa came to UI from the University of Alaska Anchorage, bringing her expansive experience in helping communities connect with and utilize university research, which she&rsquo;s used to establish UI&rsquo;s Center for Resilient Rural Communities. Most recently, she was part of a team selected to create a <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/newsevents/item?name=ui-to-partner-in-maritime-security-center-for-excellence&utm_source=10314&utm_medium=email&utm_content=homeland-security-center&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">Department of Homeland Security Center for Excellence</a></span> that will help communities with maritime ports monitor the health of their local natural resources, with an eye on maintaining port security. Dr. Alessa has also been involved in the development of a proposal for a Western Dairy Research Center.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
These and many other faculty members give the university a firm foundation of excellence. They are teachers, advisers, mentors, investigators and pioneers. With their dedication and leadership, the University of Idaho is strong &ndash; and growing stronger.</span>

            <span style=""margin:0px; padding:0px;"">Dear Friends,<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Last week at <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/envision/index.html?utm_source=101014&utm_medium=email&utm_content=envision-idaho&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">Envision Idaho</a></span>, one of our events for prospective Vandals, I welcomed more than 100 high school seniors from Idaho and beyond to our Moscow campus. For soon-to-be Vandals, it&rsquo;s an exciting time, and our beautiful campus makes quite an impression. Students have a chance to picture themselves hustling to class under the trees on the Admin Lawn, watching a football game in the Kibbie Dome, and forming enduring friendships in an ideal college town.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I suspect many students are excited to take the next step toward their future, but aren&rsquo;t yet picturing the impact an engaged, supportive faculty and staff will have on their lives. But at the University of Idaho, new students join a special community of professionals who are driven to help transform lives.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
In my own professional journey, I was fortunate to be mentored as an undergraduate by Dr. Richard Gumport, who as fate would have it actually grew up the son of a southern Idaho potato farmer. Dr. Gumport taught me much about being a scientist, challenging me to solve my own problems in research and to think seriously about discovering new knowledge, not just absorbing what is already known.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Those lessons, brought forward with humor and warmth, helped me transition from unsure undergraduate to a professional scientist and eventually a university leader, privileged to stand on a stage in front of the next generation of successful young men and women.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Experiences like my own abound at UI. As just one example, the dedicated faculty in the College of Engineering, including faculty advisor Dan Cordon, helped steer student efforts that saw the Vandal Formula Hybrid Racing Team <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/engr/newsevents/features/formula-hybrid-champions?utm_source=101014&utm_medium=email&utm_content=hybrid-racing-team&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">take the checkered flag</a></span> against other national research universities in the 2014 Formula Hybrid Competition.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Across disciplines, and not just in established programs but also in one-to-one relationships, our faculty connect with students to make a difference.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Those academic experiences are only possible because of a campus environment that nurtures and supports students. No one exemplifies this mission more than <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/homecoming/pitman-retirement?utm_source=101014&utm_medium=email&utm_content=pitman&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">retiring Vice Provost for Student Affairs and Dean of Students Bruce Pitman</a></span>. For 41 years Dean Pitman has been on the front lines for our students, armed with compassion, patience and wisdom.

&nbsp;<br>
The examples could go on and on, in individual classrooms, through laboratory research, or at an instructor&rsquo;s office hours. In ways small and large, our people are there for our students.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Next year&rsquo;s freshmen certainly do have a lot to look forward to. Imagine: 20 or 30 years from now, what professor or staff member will each student remember? Embarked on their own path, what will today&rsquo;s students have done to encourage the next generation of leaders to look at things differently, to strive for new opportunities and to achieve things they might not have believed possible?<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Thanks to engaged teachers and dedicated leaders like Bruce Pitman, epitomizing the culture of caring at UI, we have every reason to expect great things from tomorrow&rsquo;s Vandals.</span>

            <span style=""margin:0px; padding:0px;"">Dear Friends,<br>
&nbsp;<br>
From my office window, I look out over the Admin Lawn and Hello Walk where the leaves are changing colors, students are bundling up a bit more and strands from a section of the practicing marching band occasionally filter across campus. Homecoming is here.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
For many alumni, this weekend means a chance to come &ldquo;home&rdquo; to a beloved institution. For my wife and me, this special place has quickly become our home, as well, so we are eager to share in the spirit of the weekend.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Tonight Mary Beth and I look forward to joining university leaders and students in <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/Homecoming/schedule?utm_source=101714&utm_medium=email&utm_content=homecoming&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">Vandal traditions</a></span>. We&rsquo;ll join the serpentine and wind our way through campus, led by the Vandal Marching Band &mdash; one of the <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/class/music/ensembles/marching-band?utm_source=101714&utm_medium=email&utm_content=marching-band&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">best college bands</a></span> in all the country. We&rsquo;ll attend the bonfire and fireworks tonight, and after the Homecoming parade tomorrow, we&rsquo;ll return to the Kibbie Dome to cheer on our Vandals, together with so many alumni.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
With over 100,000 living alumni in Idaho and beyond, the Vandal alumni network is one of our institution&rsquo;s treasures. It is an exceptionally passionate fan base for our teams and a strong supporter of our academics. It is also a critical tool for social and economic opportunities among our graduates.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Of course, many alumni already support programs and students generously <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/inspire?utm_source=101714&utm_medium=email&utm_content=inspire_bodycopylink&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">with their donations</a></span>, and for that we are grateful. But let&rsquo;s not forget another layer of the potential impact of the Vandal network, and the relationships that can foster success for students when they leave our institution and join the workforce, eager to build rewarding careers and lives.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I have recently spent some time talking about mentoring, and how our faculty members play an important role in that work for students. But they don&rsquo;t take on this work alone &mdash; alumni have invaluable experience, connections and skills they can share with students and recent graduates.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
We know that mentoring relationships are incredibly important for student success. The Gallup organization &mdash; probably best known for their polls &mdash; has done extensive research on the well-being of students after and as a result of higher education, studying how &ldquo;engaged&rdquo; graduates are at work &mdash; how &ldquo;deeply involved in, enthusiastic about, and committed&rdquo; to their jobs students are after college.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The results are striking. Having &ldquo;a mentor who encouraged my hopes and dreams,&rdquo; as well as impactful professors and programmatic opportunities such as jobs and internships, means that graduates are much more likely to describe themselves as &ldquo;thriving&rdquo; in their well-being and feeling &ldquo;engaged&rdquo; with their work &mdash; three and two times as much, respectively.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
More than institutional selectivity, an affordable education that offers relationship-based opportunities contributes to well-being and success.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
As an institution, <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/careercenter/employers?utm_source=101714&utm_medium=email&utm_content=career-center-employers&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">we are working</a></span> to <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/careercenter/employers/internship-guide?utm_source=101714&utm_medium=email&utm_content=career-center-internship-guide&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">connect students to internships</a></span> and other opportunities where mentoring can occur. <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/cbe/experientiallearning/internshipopportunities?utm_source=101714&utm_medium=email&utm_content=cbe-internship-opportunities&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">Individual colleges</a></span> and programs do this, too, giving students a chance to apply their learning to the real world, and to form relationships that will be integral for their future career. We are always seeking to do more.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
But with 100,000 alumni and 10,000 undergraduate students, I ask you: How can we better connect you &mdash; with your experience, talent and commitment &mdash; to the employees and citizens of tomorrow? Can we better ensure that organizations like the one you may work for are reaching students with <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/careercenter/job-and-internship-fairs/for-employers?utm_source=101714&utm_medium=email&utm_content=career-center-job-fair-for-employers&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">opportunities for training and internships</a></span>? Would <em>you</em> like to get involved by visiting a class or participating in a program?<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The skills and knowledge that students gain at UI are first-class. Our institution must also excel at promoting mentoring relationships, thereby leveraging our amazing Vandal alumni network. As we look back with pride this weekend, let&rsquo;s also look forward with optimism and ideas.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Welcome home, Vandals. Whether you&rsquo;re in Moscow or rooting for the Vandals from afar, thank you for the passion, for the generosity, and for the insight into how we equip our students to succeed with engaging careers and a thriving well-being.<br>

            <span style=""margin:0px; padding:0px;"">Dear Friends,<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Most mornings I start my day by walking through the main entrance to our iconic Administration Building. On the north wall in the great arched entryway is a small historical marker, one you may have seen yourself. The inscription reads: &ldquo;Erected by the Commonwealth of Idaho for the training of her future citizens to their highest usefulness in private life and public service.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Those words represent the state&rsquo;s commitment to a robust investment in public education, as well as the university&rsquo;s promise to students.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Student success is at the heart of our mission at the University of Idaho. It is vital to future prosperity &mdash; for our students, for our state and for our world.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The University of Idaho is working to meet the state&rsquo;s goals for an educated citizenry. The Idaho State Board of Education, our institution&rsquo;s Board of Regents, has established the <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://bit.ly/1pGs1aq"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">Complete College Idaho</a></span> initiative, with a goal of 60 percent of state residents ages 25 to 34 having attained a degree or certificate by 2020.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
For individuals, this goal is critical. We know how important a well-paying job is to lifelong success. The average college graduate earns <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://reut.rs/1FM5gMB"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">$800,000 more</a></span> over a lifetime than an individual without a degree, according to a study by the Federal Reserve. And while money still can&rsquo;t buy you happiness, a well-paying job is a major factor in how many <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://bit.ly/1thBMC2"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">self-report as &ldquo;thriving.&rdquo;</a></span> College graduates don&rsquo;t just earn more &mdash; they are often happier, more engaged citizens.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Recently, the <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://bit.ly/1sVVfWd"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">Social Mobility Index</a></span> released a list of higher education institutions that succeed in helping disadvantaged citizens climb the economic ladder, measuring affordability, the background of students, graduation rates and graduate earnings. Our institution ranked No. 21 nationwide, joining institutions such as the University of California-Berkeley and UCLA in the top 25.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
This semester, 36 percent of our students will be of the first generation in their families to go to college. An affordable, high-quality education means they are in a great position for a rewarding career, an effort we will support to our utmost. Our university is truly an engine for social mobility.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
It is no secret that students graduate into an increasingly global economy, where a highly skilled workforce is needed to propel innovation and industry. More and better-paying jobs in technology, agriculture and other growing sectors mean healthier communities and brighter tomorrows for future generations.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The University of Idaho is doing its part to provide the workforce essential for our state &mdash; a <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://bit.ly/ZPulW1"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">talent pipeline</a></span> for industry, but also a prosperity pipeline for individuals, families and communities.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
However &mdash; and you may spot this as a now-common refrain of mine &mdash; we can do more. We can be better.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
To help achieve the state&rsquo;s 60 percent goal, and to reach more students with a transformative experience, we have to work hard. We must grow enrollment. At 77 percent, our freshman retention rate is strong, matching the national average for institutions like ours, but it can be stronger. We must also continue aligning our curricula to the demands of the economy.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
We will get there. The challenges are great, but so are the opportunities. Daily, the graduates of the University of Idaho see returns on the investment in their education. As an institution, we strive to increase the state&rsquo;s return on investment in its future, one student at a time.</span>

            <span style=""margin:0px; padding:0px;"">Dear Friends,<br>
&nbsp;<br>
With Veteran&rsquo;s Day around the corner, we have an opportunity to <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/newsevents/item?name=ui-celebrates-military-appreciation-day-nov-1&utm_source=103114&utm_medium=email&utm_content=military-appreciation-day-nov-1&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">recognize the service</a></span> of the men and women in our armed forces &mdash; student cadets here at the University of Idaho, current military and returning veterans.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
In &ldquo;This Crested Hill,&rdquo; a history of our university, we&rsquo;re reminded that &ldquo;The University of Idaho grew in part from the idea that land-grant colleges should provide the nation with a ready fighting force, a body of responsible citizen soldiers.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The university&rsquo;s first military commander, Lieutenant Edward R. Chrisman, took the reins in 1894, overseeing the training &mdash; then compulsory &mdash; of all male students. A large percentage of UI students served in the Spanish-American War, and our students and graduates have served the U.S. military since. Women also played a role in our early military history, as the fabled, albeit informal, &ldquo;Company C&rdquo; organized in the late 1800s presaged a later age when women would serve alongside men in the <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/army-rotc?utm_source=103114&utm_medium=email&utm_content=army-rotc&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">Army</a></span>, <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/navy-rotc?utm_source=103114&utm_medium=email&utm_content=navy-rotc&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">Navy</a></span> and <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/financialaid/scholarships/more-scholarship-opportunities/rotcmilitaryscholarship?utm_source=103114&utm_medium=email&utm_content=rotc-scholarships&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">Air Force</a></span> ROTC units.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Then as today, ROTC cadets grow as leaders. Some think of leadership as an innate or natural quality, but at UI we know that leadership can be inspired, nurtured and honed &mdash; for military service and for life outside the military.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Military service enhances our security in many ways, not always by force. Our military serves in humanitarian missions that enhance global understanding. This past summer, three cadets from the Army ROTC&rsquo;s Chrisman Battalion participated in the Army&rsquo;s Culture and Language Program, <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/army-rotc/news-resources/on-a-mission-to-learn?utm_source=103114&utm_medium=email&utm_content=mission-to-learn-feature&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">each visiting a different country</a></span>: Bosnia, Montenegro and Senegal. They assisted with flood relief, delivered humanitarian supplies, and forged bonds with servicemen and servicewomen across the world.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
We are proud of the ambassadorial work these young men and women undertake on behalf of the university, the state of Idaho and the nation.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The university endeavors to serve the men and women who serve us. We currently serve more than 300 GI Bill benefit recipients. <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/operationeducation?utm_source=103114&utm_medium=email&utm_content=operation-education&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">Operation Education</a></span> is a signature program at the university, assisting disabled veterans beyond what the GI Bill offers, even helping family members. Operation Education started at the UI, but chapters have now formed at other universities. Generous donor support makes this critical program possible.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
A strong supporter of Operation Education has been <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/newsevents/archive/alumni/generaljimamos?utm_source=103114&utm_medium=email&utm_content=general-amos&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">General James F. Amos</a></span>, who retired in October 2014 as the 35th commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps, and who is a 1970 graduate of the University of Idaho in business and economics. General Amos&rsquo; wife, Bonnie, and my wife, Mary Beth, are the <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/operationeducation/advisory-council?utm_source=103114&utm_medium=email&utm_content=op-ed-advisory-council&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">honorary co-chairs</a></span> of Operation Education. Operation Education&rsquo;s Advisory Board is chaired by David Decker. We are lucky to have the support of these dedicated leaders.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I did not serve in the military, but my father was a WWII veteran. A college student before the war, he joined the Army after Pearl Harbor, and rushed to complete his degree in 1942 before going to Europe and serving as an engineer under General Patton.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
At Homecoming this year, I was fortunate to meet and have my picture taken with Roger Guernsey, a member of the &ldquo;Greatest Generation.&rdquo;<br>

 This generation came home to build careers and families, making the United States a dominant political and economic force. My father&rsquo;s service first instilled in me the high regard I have for the military. This respect is reinforced by the veterans and servicemen and servicewomen that I meet.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I hope you&rsquo;ll join me in reflecting on the example of leadership and commitment that men and women in uniform &mdash; whether cadets on campus, active duty personnel or veterans &mdash; set for us all.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
We would not be the nation that we are today without them. Furthermore, we cannot be the university that we aspire to be without embracing the value that our tradition of military service, and the men and women who carry it out as citizen soldiers, bring to our campus, our state, and our world.</span>

            <span style=""margin:0px; padding:0px;"">Dear Friends,<br>
&nbsp;<br>
One of the pressing challenges in our state &mdash; and a broader <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://bit.ly/1Aw5p6E"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">regional and national trend</a></span> &mdash; is a <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://bit.ly/13PWJcS"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">troubling shortfall</a></span> in the number of physicians available to attend to a growing and aging population.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
You may have heard me jokingly mention that when I moved to Idaho with my wife, Mary Beth, I did my part to address the physician shortage in Idaho. As Mary Beth practices as a hospitalist, fully half the people involved in our move to Idaho are medical doctors.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Of course, that&rsquo;s hardly a scalable approach to a challenge of this magnitude. The state of Idaho actually ranks 49th nationwide in physicians per capita, a deficit that is particularly pronounced and felt in our many rural communities. The shortage means reduced access to medical care, including preventative care that keeps minor health concerns from becoming major challenges, creating a ripple effect of economic and societal consequences.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Our opportunity to address this shortage in a meaningful way is through expanded access to medical training.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The University of Idaho leads on this issue through participation in a joint medical program through the University of Washington called WWAMI &mdash; short for Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho. While there has been a split between Washington State University and the University of Washington &mdash; the former is pulling out of WWAMI to embark on its own medical training program in Spokane &mdash; WWAMI remains an ideal fit for the University of Idaho in many ways.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The WWAMI program <em>is </em>Idaho&rsquo;s medical school, holding its doors open to aspiring doctors from our state since 1971. Nearly 300 Idaho WWAMI students have returned to Idaho to practice medicine, armed with the very best medical education &mdash; according to U.S. News and World Report&rsquo;s most recent rankings, the University of Washington ranked <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://bit.ly/1qsWRUs"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">No. 1 for primary care</a></span>, No. 1 for family medicine, and among the best in many other specialties.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Recognizing the looming physician shortage, in 2009 the Idaho State Board of Education established a goal of moving from 20 to 40 seats for Idaho students in the WWAMI program. Last year we reached 30 seats. This year, we are seeking continued funding for last year&rsquo;s seats, as well as five additional seats for a total of 35. Our request has been approved by the State Board of Education and will go before the state legislature in the spring.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
This is important progress we need to make &mdash; the health and prosperity of our state depends on it.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
More than 50 percent of the students we send to WWAMI eventually practice medicine in Idaho &mdash; a very high rate of return. One such student is Grangeville&rsquo;s <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/inspire/stories/Lee-Spencer?utm_source=11714&utm_medium=email&utm_content=lee-spencer&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">Lee Spencer</a></span>. Lee is a participant in the Targeted Rural and Underserved Students (TRUST) track of the WWAMI program. The TRUST track connects underserved, often rural communities with aspiring doctors. Students from Idaho can complete their first 18 months in Idaho, then head to Seattle for a year before choosing locations for residencies.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Lee would like to return to Idaho to practice in a rural community like the one where he grew up.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s where the need is,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;d be hard to find a place where your money can have more return than investing in rural, family physicians. You can prevent so many health problems for people, making it possible for kids to have successful, productive lives, and stopping health problems before they start.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
We need more dedicated professionals like Lee to have an opportunity to come back to our state. Five new WWAMI students at a time, we can build a healthier Idaho.</span>

&nbsp;<br>
Approximately 70 percent of the goal has been met thanks to several recent fundraising challenges. President Staben offered a $200,000 match, inspiring donors to contribute. Library advisory board chair Gary Strong &rsquo;66 also pledged up to $5,000 to match commitments by his fellow board members. More than $41,000 has since been added to the library fund, including major gifts by Ron and Jo Ellen Force and David &rsquo;74 and Julie &rsquo;75 Levine.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&ldquo;The library is a focal point for student success,&rdquo; said Dean Lynn Baird. &ldquo;With that in mind, we encourage donors to help us show President Staben how much Vandals value libraries.&rdquo; For more information on giving to the Library, contact Jim Zuba at 208-885-4142 or <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""mailto:jzuba@uidaho.edu"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">jzuba@uidaho.edu</a></span>.&nbsp;</td>

            <span style=""margin:0px; padding:0px;"">Dear Friends,<br>
&nbsp;<br>
For a sports fan, and for a supporter of the University of Idaho, this is an <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://bit.ly/1xUc5pO"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">exciting weekend</a></span>. The University of Idaho men&rsquo;s basketball team kicks off another season at historic Memorial Gymnasium, the volleyball team finishes up a strong Big Sky campaign ahead of the conference tournament, and our much-improved football squad takes the field for their final home game. It is a good occasion to reflect on the role that sports play in our lives and at our university.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Sports have always been an important part of my life. I was on the tennis and swim teams in high school, and played racquetball throughout college, a passion I&rsquo;ve continued &mdash; you may have heard me offer to buy lunch for the student who can beat me in a match. I&rsquo;ve always found that sports present an opportunity to build personal discipline, forge lasting relationships and enjoy a unique camaraderie.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
My two sons were college athletes, both swimmers. I watched them pursue their sport with dedication, persevering through a challenging program of training and competition while also realizing their academic goals. It was not easy for them, but they took the dual role of student-athlete seriously, and I think the focus and discipline they found through their sports served them well during their undergraduate years and now in medical school.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
That commitment is matched by what I have seen from our student-athletes at the University of Idaho. During a year where they competed in their new home in the Sun Belt &mdash; a strong place for our football program to be &mdash; 18 students on the Vandal football team recently made the Sun Belt&rsquo;s Academic Honor Roll or Commissioner&rsquo;s List for outstanding GPAs.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Tomorrow is our last home game for Vandal football, Senior Day for many of the players. These seniors have persevered through adversity, and many have been great ambassadors for both the university&rsquo;s athletics and its academics.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
As one example among many, I have had the pleasure of getting to know <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/inspire/stories/maxx-forde?utm_source=111414&utm_medium=email&utm_content=inspire-forde&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">senior defensive end Maxx Forde</a></span>, a double major in marketing and finance. After his pursuit of football, Maxx plans to tackle a career in business. I have no doubt that, like most of our Vandal student-athletes, he will take the same work ethic and determination he brings to sports to life off the field, representing us well as a proud alumnus.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
For our non-football sports teams, the 2014-2015 year has brought a return to the Big Sky Conference. That follows historic success in the Western Athletic Conference (WAC), including eight team championships last season that earned UI the <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://bit.ly/1BkX0mR"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">Commissioner&rsquo;s Cup trophy</a></span> for overall success.<br>
<br>
The Big Sky is an opportunity to renew historic rivalries and continue building on that success. Our volleyball team is off to a promising start, with a strong regular season that has qualified them for the conference tournament. This August our volleyball team earned the American Volleyball Coaches Association&rsquo;s Team Academic Award for the fourth consecutive season for maintaining at least a 3.30 cumulative team GPA. On the court and in the classroom, they are embodying the student-athlete ideal.<br>
<br>
Athletics bring more to our university than school pride. Providing financial and academic support, personal development, and camaraderie, athletics offers opportunities for college success to students who otherwise might not participate in higher education. Contrary to the sometimes negative perceptions of student athletes, Division I athletic programs &mdash; often the most diverse units in schools &mdash; succeed in graduating student-athletes at <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://on.ncaa.com/1xUcbOk"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">rates higher than their non-athlete peers</a></span>.<br>
<br>
For so many student-athletes, success on the court or on the field is not just a complement to academic success, it is central to that achievement.<br>
<br>
I hope you will join me this weekend and throughout the year in rooting on our Vandal athletes. On the field, in the classroom and in the world after graduation, they give us much to cheer about.</span>

            <span style=""margin:0px; padding:0px;"">Dear Friends,<br>
&nbsp;<br>
As Idaho&rsquo;s land-grant research university, we pursue research that pushes the frontiers of knowledge and makes a difference in people&rsquo;s lives.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
We humans have a natural curiosity. We want to understand our place in the universe. We intrinsically value knowledge and seek to acquire it. We also want to explore concrete ways of enhancing our lives, putting research to work improving health and well-being, economies, and communities.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Day in and day out, in classrooms, in laboratories, and in the field across Idaho and the world, we are leading the quest for knowledge, both basic and applied.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
In one case, that search has again taken us to outer space. Jason Barnes, associate professor of physics at UI, is working with his students and researchers around the country to create dazzling new photographs of the vast methane <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/sci/physics/news/topfeatures/waves-on-titan?utm_source=112114&utm_medium=email&utm_content=seas-titan&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">seas on Titan</a></span>, a moon of Saturn. Dr. Barnes&rsquo; work enhances our understanding of the solar system and helps open the possibility of landing a spacecraft on Titan someday.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Some research at UI happens closer to home. At a time when Idahoans use <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://bit.ly/1t9iMRv"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">more water per capita</a></span> than residents of any other state, Howard Neibling, an irrigation management engineer with the University of Idaho Extension at Kimberly, is pioneering efficient irrigation techniques for Idaho farms and ranches.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
If you&rsquo;ve been to the Magic Valley, you know how it earned its nickname &mdash; <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://bit.ly/1qrT78S"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">water management</a></span> turned this dry plain into an agricultural oasis. Dr. Neibling&rsquo;s award-winning research will help Idaho agriculture continue to work its magic, doing more with less to keep our fields &mdash; and the world&rsquo;s stomachs &mdash; full.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Research isn&rsquo;t just the domain of faculty and graduate students, of course. Undergraduate students at UI have an opportunity to participate in research or scholarly activity related to their majors. For example, this summer anthropology professor Mark Warner led a team of students on an <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/class/socanthro/resources/remnants-of-life?utm_source=112114&utm_medium=email&utm_content=remnants-sociology&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">archaeological excavation</a></span> at the old &ldquo;Surgeon&rsquo;s Quarters&rdquo; in Boise. Their discoveries will be used in an exhibit at the restored building &mdash; a vital record of the history of Western settlement in the state.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I recall from my days as an undergraduate that it is often hard to see the impact of your research because you&rsquo;re doing one small, though vital, part of a larger project. As an example, the archaeological work in Boise is of a scale that brings undergraduates into the research process. Students can see some results of their work almost immediately, but they are also part of something that contributes to a much larger body of knowledge.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Of course, any attempt to chronicle the research at the University of Idaho is bound to exclude many important projects. The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching includes UI in the prestigious set of national universities classified as having &ldquo;high research activity.&rdquo; And though I regret that we cannot include a laundry list of the dynamic work, I urge you to read our <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/research/about-research/2014-research-report?utm_source=112114&utm_medium=email&utm_content=research-report-2014&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">annual research report</a></span> to get a more complete picture of the scope and impact of our efforts in this area.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I am thrilled to be among such talented and driven faculty and student researchers as those found at University of Idaho. Whether exploring the remains of the old frontier of the West or venturing into the &ldquo;final frontier,&rdquo; every day our researchers are helping us better understand our world and how we can thrive in it.&nbsp;</span>

<br>
This year at the Thanksgiving table, Mary Beth and I were thankful to be joined by our daughter, Rae, home from college. Our two sons had late exams and were not able to join us this year. Because not all students can make it home for Thanksgiving, we were pleased to host our first campus dinner for over 250 students. Some attendees were, like our sons, just not able to return home. Another large group were our international students, many enjoying their first American Thanksgiving.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Thanksgiving is a special time of year, and coming together as a family means a lot to us, as I&rsquo;m sure you can appreciate. In that spirit, we were also grateful for getting to join the Vandal family this year. We hope that all of you have also enjoyed a wonderful Thanksgiving holiday. We&rsquo;ll return with a regular Friday Letter next week, but if you have the post-Thanksgiving energy to try out some additional tasty treats, have a look at some <span style=""color: #b18e5f;margin: 0px;padding: 0px;""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/advancement/departments/donor-relations/thanksgiving-recipes?utm_source=112814&utm_medium=email&utm_content=thanksgiving-recipes-2014&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">recent and historic recipes</a></span> created by UI students in the Margaret Ritchie School of Family and Consumer Sciences.&nbsp;</p>

            <span style=""margin:0px; padding:0px;"">Dear Friends,<br>
&nbsp;<br>
This December marks a special occasion for the University of Idaho and the Vandal family. Seven years ago we embarked on an ambitious project, a $225 million capital campaign to maintain and improve upon the excellence of Idaho&rsquo;s leading national research university. Thanks to the hard work of many people, and the generosity from more than 50,000 individuals across Idaho and the world, we will ring in the New Year having achieved our goal.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The <em><span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/inspire?utm_source=12514&utm_medium=email&utm_content=inspire&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">Inspiring Futures: Invest in the University of Idaho</a></span></em> campaign is the largest comprehensive fundraising effort in the history of Idaho.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
While we&rsquo;re proud of the gaudy statistics, the <em>Inspiring Futures </em>campaign has never been about numbers alone. It is about what those numbers mean for the success of our students, for our pursuit of innovation and discovery, for our world-class learning environments, and for our ability to partner with others on areas of critical importance. The campaign has been about coming together to make a difference for our institution &mdash; and our world.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
A public institution like ours is sometimes faced with situations beyond our control. We don&rsquo;t always know what changing economic climates and demographics will mean for our university, though we strive to carefully assess that. And while we make our voice heard before the legislature, we don&rsquo;t always know <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://bit.ly/1w4reZ5"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">what that body will do</a></span> for our institution.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
But as a Vandal family, private giving is an area where we can exercise control. Collectively, we can decide that the University of Idaho is a worthwhile investment in our future. We can support programs, activities, facilities and research that develop much-needed leaders and professionals, find solutions to challenging problems, and build roadways to progress and prosperity for our state.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
As individuals, organizations and corporate partners, we can make opportunities come to life. For instance, did you know that 36 percent of students who attend the University of Idaho are first-generation college attendees?<br>
&nbsp;<br>
That includes students like Fredy Olmos. Originally from Mexico, Fredy came the United States legally as a young child, and grew up in a rural, southern Idaho farming community. His hard work and persistence helped him secure <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/inspire/stories/frederick-olmos?utm_source=12514&utm_medium=email&utm_content=seas-titan&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">15 scholarships in his freshman year</a></span>. Now a senior, he hopes to go on to graduate school in either law or management.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
That career path grew wings because people cared enough about opportunities to support scholarship programs. In fact, over the course of the campaign, 149 new scholarships have been created. Donor generosity has also produced 20 new faculty endowments.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Donors have also gifted $35 million in funding for facilities renovation and new construction. Again, great numbers, but here&rsquo;s what that translates to on the ground: expansion of the Barker Trading Room where students gain real-world financial management experience; renovation of the Haddock Performance Hall where students take center stage; a newly opened Doceo Center for Innovation and Learning that supports teachers with technology training; much-needed updates to the Kibbie Dome for our student-athletes; a new thinkTANK collaborative space in the College of Engineering; and&nbsp; many, many more brick-and-mortar improvements to take our physical spaces into the 21st century.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Student by student, family by family and dream by dream, the generosity of the Vandal family has made an overwhelming impact through the <em>Inspiring Futures</em> campaign. If you have given, or if you are going to give, we hope you have already heard loudly and clearly a message of thanks, but I will offer it to you again: Thank you.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
We are not quite done, of course. And we have many needs that will continue on after the campaign, including some projects that I think you will be very excited to support.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The <em>Inspiring Futures </em>campaign has brought us together to do our part for the next generation of leaders in the state of Idaho and beyond. Thanks to the generosity of Vandal friends and family, the future looks very bright.&nbsp;</span>

<span style=""color:#000000;"">Dear Friends,<br>
<br>
I hope this first &ldquo;Friday Letter&rdquo; of 2014 finds you enjoying a happy new year. At the University of Idaho, this new year will bring a celebration of our 125th anniversary as Idaho&rsquo;s founding, land-grant, comprehensive institution.&nbsp; It will also bring &ndash;- as every year does -&ndash; a reminder of a perennial challenge:&nbsp; pursuing excellence with constrained public resources. In 1954, one of the University of Idaho&rsquo;s finest presidents, Dr. Donald R. Theophilus, wrote to the faculty:</span><br>
<span style=""color:#000000;"">&nbsp;<br>
<em>This afternoon I leave for Boise for a review of our budget needs&hellip;. Our requests are based on a level of expenditure that will assure appropriate standards and quality of instruction and research controlled by judicious management. The anticipated operations are, we believe, within the means provided by the wealth and income of Idaho to support. Our job in making an adequate and convincing presentation to the Legislature of the University&rsquo;s needs will be materially supported and aided by a high level of job performance on your part</em> [the faculty].<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Six decades later, the &ldquo;job performance&rdquo; of our faculty has made the University worthy of its flagship heritage, of continued public confidence, and of elevated public investment. I am pleased to report that Idaho Governor C.L. &ldquo;Butch&rdquo; Otter has made education the principal theme of his 2014 State of the State address, and he has released budget recommendations to the Legislature that would underwrite substantial improvements in support for education at all levels in Fiscal Year 2015.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
With respect to post-secondary education, the Governor has emphasized the synergy between education and economic development, recommending investments in higher education and professional-technical programs that are &ldquo;measured, manageable and within our means.&rdquo; His recommendations include:</span>

<ul>
	<li><span style=""color:#000000;"">Additional funding for high-demand academic programs at each of Idaho&rsquo;s four-year colleges and universities, in support of the State Board&rsquo;s &ldquo;Complete College Idaho&rdquo; initiative. This would bring approximately $1.05 million to the University of Idaho for more instructional capacity.</span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><span style=""color:#000000;"">An increase of $1.5 million for our university&rsquo;s Agricultural Research and Extension Service, which has contributed significantly to the success of Idaho agriculture. Idaho&rsquo;s agricultural earnings have doubled in value over the past 15 years, making agriculture as the largest single sector of the state&rsquo;s economy. Farm revenues have increased for three successive years, enabling Idaho to become the third largest agriculture state in the West, following California and nearly equaling Washington.</span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><span style=""color:#000000;"">Increasing by $1 million the State of Idaho&rsquo;s investment in the Center for Advanced Energy Studies in Idaho Falls. This center &ndash;- a collaborative undertaking of faculty at the University of Idaho, Idaho State University, and Boise State University, in cooperation with the Idaho National Laboratory -&ndash; has produced breakthrough, high-tech research with a high multiplier effect upon economic development.</span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><span style=""color:#000000;"">Adding $400,000 to our legal education program in Boise, giving students an opportunity to take second-year courses along with the existing third-year curriculum in the state capital. This curricular enhancement, authorized by the State Board, would enable students in our Juris Doctor program (which entails three years of graduate-level study), to pursue upper-level specialties in Moscow and Boise based on the comparative advantages each location offers. In Moscow, these advantages include natural resources and environmental law, Native American and tribal law, and dispute resolution.&nbsp; In Boise the advantages include business law, economic development, and certain forms of regulatory law. The overall program design embodies a &ldquo;Moscow plus Boise&rdquo; approach, utilizing complementary locations that maximize student opportunities and fulfill our university&rsquo;s statewide mission.</span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><span style=""color:#000000;"">Increasing by approximately $1.1 million the funding available for the employer&rsquo;s share of the rising costs of health insurance provided to University of Idaho faculty and staff.</span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><span style=""color:#000000;"">Investing approximately $252,000 in the second cohort of students filling last year&rsquo;s five-seat enrollment expansion in our WWAMI (Washington-Wyoming-Alaska-Montana-Idaho) medical education program. This program enables Doctor of Medicine (MD) students to begin their studies in Idaho, take advanced classes at the acclaimed University of Washington Medical School, and participate in clinical experiences throughout the WWAMI area. Students receive a lower-cost medical education and graduate with less debt than they would incur in conventional medical education programs, thereby making it feasible for them to devote their careers to lower-paying specialties and under-served communities.</span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><span style=""color:#000000;"">Providing approximately $2.4 million as an inflationary adjustment to funding for scientific equipment, information technology, media devices, etc., at the University of Idaho. This is the first time in recent years that such an adjustment has been recommended.</span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><span style=""color:#000000;"">Setting aside $29 million in the Public Education Stabilization Fund, and $7 million in a recently created Higher Education Stabilization Fund. This would improve higher education planning and administration by minimizing the need for disruptive holdbacks during budget periods if and when state revenues fall short of projections.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style=""color:#000000;"">The university is grateful for the Governor&rsquo;s recommendations. Needless to say, we did not receive everything we requested. The recommendations do not include a requested additional five-seat expansion of the WWAMI program, support for certain wildlife and geological survey faculty, or &ndash;- most notably &ndash;- a general salary adjustment (known in budget parlance as CEC, or change in employee compensation) for faculty and staff as well as other state employees. The Legislature has convened a previously dormant CEC committee, however, and it appears that the Legislature may consider some kind of independent CEC action.<br>
<br>
President Theophilus concluded his 1954 missive to the faculty on an aspirational note that resonates today: &ldquo;May I &hellip; express the hope that our united efforts combined with a faith in the future will make possible the achievement of the tremendous possibilities of the University of Idaho.&rdquo;<br>

<span style=""color:#000000;""><strong>Greenhouse Gas Emissions Decrease On UI Campus.</strong> As the uncertainty regarding future climate change looms overhead, the university is doing its part to curb greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, emissions during 2011 on the UI campus decreased 12.5 percent compared to 2005.&nbsp; The university conducts an annual GHG inventory in accordance with the requirements of the American College and University Presidents&rsquo; Climate Commitment &ndash; a Carnegie initiative in which most U.S.-based colleges and universities participate. The UI signaled its commitment to climate neutrality by signing the Talloires Declaration in 2005. The UI joined the Chicago Climate Exchange and ACUPCC in 2007. The Talloires Declaration and ACUPCC both call for the higher education community to provide leadership in addressing climate change.</span><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/newsevents/item?name=greenhouse-gas-emissions-decrease-on-ui-campus"" target=""_self""><strong> Read more.</strong></a><br>

<span style=""color:#000000;""><strong>Prof Works with International Team To Study Plants Adaptation To Cold. </strong>A team of plant researchers including University of Idaho biologist David Tank has assembled the largest dated evolutionary tree, using it to show the order in which flowering plants evolved specific strategies, such as the seasonal shedding of leaves, to move into areas with cold winters. The results will be published Dec. 22 in the journal<em> Nature</em>. Early flowering plants are thought to have been woody &mdash; maintaining a prominent stem above ground across years and changing weather conditions, such as maple trees &mdash; and restricted to warm, wet tropical environments. But they have since put down roots in chillier climates, dominating large swaths of the globe where freezing occurs. How they managed this expansion has long vexed researchers searching for plants&rsquo; equivalent to the winter parka.</span> <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/newsevents/item?name=ui-prof-works-with-international-team-to-study-how-plants-evolved-to-weather-the-cold"" target=""_self""><strong>Read more.</strong></a><br>

<span style=""color:#000000;""><strong>Donors Leave A Legacy Of Help For International Studies Students. </strong>Thanks to the foresight of the late Victor H. Skiles &rsquo;40 and his wife, Ruth Nay Skiles, the <strong><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/class/martin-institute"" target=""_self"">University of Idaho Martin Institute</a> </strong>continues to help students seeking Foreign Service careers. After graduation, Skiles worked for several federal government agencies, but much of his career was spent in the U.S. Agency for International Development where he led U.S. assistance efforts worldwide, including Israel, Africa and South Asia. In 1973, he was appointed as the USAID Representative to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization. He retired in 1978. In 2006, Victor and Ruth established the Skiles Endowment for International Affairs to provide scholarships for students in the International Studies Program. Because of the impact international experience had on the Skiles, a preference is given to students studying abroad and those seeking to enter the Foreign Service. While Victor passed away in 2011, Ruth continues to support the couple&rsquo;s scholarship. In 2013, Ruth notified the university that she had provided for a gift to the Skiles Endowment in her estate plans, and in December, she made a generous gift to the scholarship for immediate use.

            <span style=""margin:0px; padding:0px;"">Dear Friends,<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Tonight Mary Beth and I attend a special event on the Palouse, the Jazz Choirs Holiday Concert in Moscow. With the participation of more than 700 local and regional elementary, junior high school, and high school choir members, as well as the performance groups at the University of Idaho under the direction of <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/newsevents/item?name=longtime-u-idaho-music-professor-receives-national-teaching-award&utm_source=121114&utm_medium=email&utm_content=bukvich-award&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">award-winning professor</a></span> Dan Bukvich, the occasion highlights the power of the arts to bring our community together.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
We get many chances to see the power of the arts at the University of Idaho. The <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/jazzfest?utm_source=121114&utm_medium=email&utm_content=jazz-fest&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival</a></span>, a must-attend event every February, provides thrilling entertainment for our community and a dynamic learning opportunity for thousands of K-12 and many UI students. The Jazz Fest earned UI the distinction of being the only public university to receive the National Medal of the Arts &mdash; the nation&rsquo;s top arts honor.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Our university&rsquo;s embrace of the arts is year-round. Just last week, the Idaho Repertory Theater and University of Idaho Theatre Arts opened &ldquo;A Christmas Carol&rdquo; at the Hartung Theatre &mdash; a cast and crew of more than 50 people put together this show. The Pritchard Gallery in downtown Moscow features work from students and faculty, as well as artists from all over the country. And programs such as the Hemingway Festival, a unique literary event with readings, presentations and visiting authors, bring scholars and citizens together.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Vandal artistic endeavor also attracts state and national notice. Kim Barnes, professor of creative writing in our English department, was recently honored with the&nbsp;<span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://bit.ly/1yY962k"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">Governor&rsquo;s Award for the Arts</a></span> for her contributions to literature. You may have seen Prichard Art Gallery Director Roger Rowley&rsquo;s artwork featured on &ldquo;<span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://cbsn.ws/1teQJ3h"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">CBS Sunday Morning</a></span>&rdquo; in November. The list could go on and on, filled with brilliantly creative people, programs and places.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I couldn&rsquo;t imagine life without the enriching experience of art. As a scientist, I often take a highly rational approach to engaging the world. The arts have helped me to understand that there are also interpretive and emotional approaches to seeing the world.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Unfortunately, the liberal arts have been attacked by public figures and media reports, claiming that careers outside STEM disciplines don&rsquo;t benefit students financially. Data from New York Federal Reserve economists say otherwise; the <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://nyfed.org/1x8dTir"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">return on investment</a></span> for students in those degree paths is 12 percent yearly &mdash; only one important measure of success.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Tonight we&rsquo;ll be enjoying the musicianship and celebrating the holiday season. Interim Provost Katherine Aiken and I actually have our own small parts to play in tonight&rsquo;s concert, and I admit to being a bit nervous, as musical performance is <em>well</em> outside my comfort zone. Please <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/newsevents/uidaholive?utm_source=121114&utm_medium=email&utm_content=uidaho-live&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">listen closely to the real artists</a></span>, our faculty and students, as you enjoy the drum group&rsquo;s performance tonight. And, enjoy the power of the arts to enrich our lives. &nbsp;</span>

            <span style=""margin:0px; padding:0px;"">Dear Friends,<br>
<br>
At the beginning of December I had the opportunity, with several other university leaders, to visit China. Our trip had multiple objectives, including visiting a dairy research institute in Harbin; touring and meeting with leaders from our Chinese partner institution, the South China University of Technology (SCUT); and participating in an international conference for the Confucius Institute. It was my fourth visit to China, and first as president of UI.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Harbin, in northern China, has a distinctly Russian architectural and cultural imprint. At the Nestl&eacute; Dairy Farming Institute in the city, I was joined by Dean John Foltz from the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences, Dean Jie Chen with the College of Graduate Studies, and Mary Beth. We toured the facility in wind-chill temperatures that reached 25 below zero. The institute is a private-public partnership of the University of Wisconsin, Nestle, Alltech and several other companies that provide services for breeding, feed and milking equipment. The institute is expanding its applied research capabilities, and it is an interesting collaboration to learn from as we move forward with a dairy research initiative in Idaho.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
From Harbin, Dean Chen, Mary Beth and I headed to Guangzhou, in southern China, the country&rsquo;s third-largest city and home to <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://bit.ly/1wG2WDg"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">SCUT</a></span>. Associate Professor Matthew Wappett and Dr. Hiaxen Xue, co-directors of UI&rsquo;s Confucius Institute, met us for tours of the &ldquo;Education Megacenter&rdquo; campus, discussions with SCUT researchers and a meeting with the university&rsquo;s president. We also had a meeting with the Confucius Institute board of directors, exploring ways of broadening our academic cooperation to include additional student and faculty exchanges, study abroad options, and other cultural and academic programming. Guangzhou, as you might imagine, is a bustling city with a complex history &mdash; in the past, during the period of British presence, the penalties for teaching Chinese to a foreigner were harsh. Now the Confucius Institute drives efforts to facilitate understanding of language and culture &mdash; inviting foreigners in, instead of keeping them out.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Here you might be asking: What exactly is the <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/class/confucius-institute?utm_source=121714_special-china&utm_medium=email&utm_content=confucius&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">Confucius Institute</a></span>? While these centers exist across the United States, the program at UI is the only one in Idaho. A partnership with Hanban, the Chinese government ministry, UI&rsquo;s program was established in 2013 and provides an array of opportunities, including Chinese language instruction for K-12 and UI students, exciting cultural events and performances, panel discussions and seminars, and more.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The Confucius Institute at UI serves as a critical bridge between our state and what will soon be the world&rsquo;s largest economy. In just over a year this program has already accomplished much, and its continued growth (including statewide programming in places such as Boise) will be a boon to students, community members, business leaders and others across Idaho.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Travelling next to Xiamen, we attended the Confucius Institute International Conference. Xiamen is a city of 2 million people, with many temples, a major university, markets filled with fresh fruit and an abundance of tantalizing restaurants. At the conference I learned about some of the challenges and opportunities other programs face, and I was privileged to be one of the few university presidents to gain a face-to-face meeting with Chinese government&rsquo;s minister of culture. Madame Zhu emphasized, in English, the importance of learning each other&rsquo;s languages. I delivered a presentation about our Confucius Institute&rsquo;s great progress over the last year, noting that we would like to increase our impact on and off campus.<br>
<br>
China is a country that is rapidly moving forward. We caught many glimpses of its history, its vibrant economy, and intriguing culture &mdash; the kind of understandings that are important for building effective relationships. <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/president/communications/presentations/china-trip-slideshow?utm_source=121714_special-china&utm_medium=email&utm_content=slideshow-china-bodycopylink&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">(View a gallery of trip photos.)</a></span> Partnering with China through SCUT and the Confucius Institute is a key to the future for our university and for the state of Idaho.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
We have travelled far in the past year, and in the future we will go even further.</span>

            <span style=""margin:0px; padding:0px;"">Dear Friends,<br>
&nbsp;<br>
As we approach the New Year, our university&rsquo;s <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/125years?utm_source=121914&utm_medium=email&utm_content=125th&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">125th anniversary</a></span> draws to a close. The anniversary proved a fortuitous time to join the Vandal family &mdash; the pride in our institution&rsquo;s achievements and the optimism about our future are all the welcome a new president could ever ask for.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Now a leading national research university, <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/125years/Our-Heritage?utm_source=121914&utm_medium=email&utm_content=125th-heritage&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">Idaho&rsquo;s land-grant school</a></span> emerged from humble, often muddy beginnings on the hills outside Moscow. President James A. MacLean, the third president of the University of Idaho, guided construction of new facilities, including the school&rsquo;s first gymnasium; raised admission standards and helped shape the modern academic experience; and warded off efforts to relocate key university programs, such as the School of Mines and the College of Agriculture.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
When a fire gutted the Administration Building, MacLean found a way to rebuild it, and the iconic building stands tall more than 100 years later. MacLean&rsquo;s nearly 13-year tenure is an example to all Vandals &mdash; and Vandal presidents &mdash; of what can be accomplished with vision, hard work and dedication.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Not all success stories are as well-known. At a recent event, our provost and historian Katherine Aiken told the story of Alfred Carlton Gilbert, a young Oregonian who was inspired while watching University of Idaho pole vaulters at the turn of the 20th century.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&ldquo;I thought it was wonderful, soaring so high in the air just by using a pole,&rdquo; Gilbert said. He decided to give it a try himself, and, favoring a bamboo pole, revolutionized the sport and won Olympic gold in 1908.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
If you grew up with an Erector set, you also have A.C. Gilbert to thank &mdash; he invented them in 1913, and in 1918 successfully argued against a wartime proposal to ban toy production. That effort earned Gilbert the nickname &ldquo;The Man Who Saved Christmas.&rdquo; Sometimes Vandal spirit is contagious, it seems.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
That spirit of innovation &mdash; sometimes from unexpected people and places &mdash; is a Vandal tradition that we&rsquo;ve celebrated all year. I was able to attend the <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/125years/Anniversary?utm_source=121914&utm_medium=email&utm_content=125th-proclamation&utm_campaign=friday-letter14"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">Jan. 30</a></span> &ldquo;birthday party&rdquo; in Moscow, one of several statewide celebrations throughout the year. The Vandal family embraced our anniversary year, attending events, participating on <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://on.fb.me/QwMuU4"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">social media</a></span> and generously displaying Vandal pride all year.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
We can build off that positive energy. We will grow our university&rsquo;s impact: Our students will go on to become leaders, our research will continue to change our world, and our outreach will help our state&rsquo;s communities improve. We will build on our proven success. Like those who have come before us, we will find a way.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Lastly, a word of thanks for the many who contributed to make this a special year. My predecessor Don Burnett kept the anniversary on the right track. Volunteers on several committees and countless other students, faculty and staff members worked hard to pull together the many pieces of this year-long celebration. This labor of love paid off for all of us, a fitting showcase for Vandal excellence in the past, present and future.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Who knows what Vandals and those they inspire will accomplish in the next 125 years?</span>

Hank Ebert &rsquo;77 recently received such a call from Kelsey, an international studies major. Ebert made a gift to the Honors Program, but the connection did not end there. Kelsey had mentioned she was looking forward to working in the Foreign Service after graduation, so Ebert, the son of a U.S. Foreign Service Officer, offered to meet with Kelsey and fellow students to discuss their career objectives and life in the Foreign Service. He visited the call center this fall and has made plans to return in the spring to meet again with Kelsey and other students who are interested in working and living abroad.

            <span style=""margin:0px; padding:0px;"">Dear Friends,<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I hope the New Year finds you well, having spent well-earned time with friends and loved ones. Mary Beth and I had a wonderful holiday in Idaho with our family, too. Having our children home reminded me of when they were young and we read books with them; maybe this experience and the author I&rsquo;m about to quote resonates with you as well.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Our university has come a long way in a relatively short amount of time, yet we are only getting started. As Dr. Seuss wisely said, &ldquo;You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself any direction you choose.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
With that in mind, I&rsquo;d like to share some of the directions Vandals have chosen to take recently. A new working group of biology and statistics researchers called the Collaboratorium for Modeling Complex Problems, together with Associate Professor Marty Ytreberg of physics, has received a National Science Foundation grant. The grant enables this group to build models that study the evolutionary possibilities of <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/sci/newsevents/features/ebola-working-group?utm_source=1915&utm_medium=email&utm_content=sci_ebola-feature&utm_campaign=friday-letter15"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">the Ebola virus</a></span> &mdash; timely research in the wake of the devastating epidemic in West Africa.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Research also has practical impacts closer to home, exemplified by the role of the Aquaculture Research Institute in the development of the Kootenai Tribe&rsquo;s <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/aquaculture/research/article?utm_source=1915&utm_medium=email&utm_content=aquaculture_burbot-feature&utm_campaign=friday-letter15"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">new burbot fishery</a></span>, an exciting development for fisheries science, conservation and culture.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Our graduates have even had out of-this-world experiences. December 2014 graduate John Herrington had already been the first Native American in space, but back on Earth he charted a new course as the recipient of a doctoral degree in education. Mechanical engineering master&rsquo;s graduate Sophie Milam traveled to Hawaii on a NASA mission to spend eight months in a dome that simulates conditions on Mars. Sophie was just named to Forbes magazine&rsquo;s prestigious <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://onforb.es/1IxbePR"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">&ldquo;30 Under 30 2015 in Science&rdquo;</a></span> list.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Even though every student can choose a direction, often students can find their footing with the mentorship of committed teachers at the University of Idaho. Professor Karen Launchbaugh, in the College of Natural Resources, was named the <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/newsevents/features/launchbaugh-professor-of-the-year?utm_source=1915&utm_medium=email&utm_content=launchbaugh-feature&utm_campaign=friday-letter15"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">2014 U.S. Professor of the Year</a></span> for the state of Idaho in November. She was honored for making extra effort to get her students hands-on learning experiences.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Our School of Food Science Professor Greg M<strong>&ouml;</strong>ller, <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/cals/news/feature/moller-teaching-award?utm_source=1915&utm_medium=email&utm_content=moller-feature&utm_campaign=friday-letter15"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">recipient of the National USDA Excellence in Teaching Award</a></span> given by the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, was honored for his commitment to reaching students through digital education, a boon for students who aren&rsquo;t always even in the same time zone.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I could go on and on, describing the excellence at Idaho&rsquo;s leading national research university. And that&rsquo;s just the point: We Vandals <em>will</em> go on for the next 125 years of excellence in classrooms and lecture halls, in laboratories and in fieldwork, in our athletic endeavors and in our communities. Some of that work will receive awards, but much of it will go quietly appreciated by students, lauded by colleagues in research, and applied to great effect in our communities and economy.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I am looking forward to the places we will go!&nbsp;</span>

            <span style=""margin:0px; padding:0px;"">Dear Friends,<br>
&nbsp;<br>
This has been a difficult week in Moscow. We mourn the tragic loss of members of our community and our Vandal family. I know the thoughts of Vandals everywhere &mdash; in Moscow and beyond &mdash; have been with the families and friends of those we&rsquo;ve lost.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The victims of last weekend&rsquo;s tragedy were deeply involved members of the Moscow community, and our town and our institution will surely suffer for their absence. The many expressions of sympathy this week attest to their characters &mdash; their passion, their service to others, their long roots in this shared home of ours.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The outpouring of care and concern testifies to what unites us as people, as Vandals. These wounds will never fully heal, but we take on the challenge together, as always. &nbsp;Moscow is a special community, and it is a safe community. In time, I know that we will emerge stronger and more resilient.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
This weekend we join with others across Idaho and the nation to honor the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. The civil rights leader helped build a more just society, and his message of peace is a lasting legacy for all times. I find this quote powerful: &ldquo;Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.&rdquo; Let&rsquo;s rely on each other, and offer love and support for one another in this trying time.<br>
<br>
At the University of Idaho, the ASUI Center for Volunteerism and Social Action organizes the participation of students, faculty and staff around the holiday we know in Idaho as Martin Luther King Jr. &mdash; Idaho Human Rights Day. The National Day of Service seeks to answer the call brought forth by Reverend King, who said, &ldquo;Life&rsquo;s most persistent and urgent question is: &lsquo;What are you doing for others?&rsquo;&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Each year, Vandals answer that question with projects that make a difference for those in need in communities across Moscow and all of Idaho. As part of the Martin Luther King Jr. Day of Service, the Volunteer Center will coordinate the efforts of nearly 100 student volunteers &mdash; many just back from participating in Alternative Service Breaks &mdash; to pitch in at nonprofits across the community. In addition, the Office of Multicultural Affairs is leading a food drive for the Vandal Food Pantry to help families in need.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
That service is an example of the difference we can make for others &mdash; really, for each other. Serving others is not always the easy thing. But it is the right thing, and it leads to lasting effects. I am proud of the work that the university community does for others around this special weekend.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
And I am so proud of how we have come together this week to support those who are hurting. Let us continue to take care of each other, taking heart and comfort through the strength and service of our Vandal and Moscow family.</span>

Five generations of Marboes have graduated from UI, and three generations have donned the silver and gold in athletics; most recently Scott and Maribeth&rsquo;s son Mike started at center for the Vandal football team the past four years. Scott currently serves on the VSF National Board, and he and Maribeth have been members of the Vandal Scholarship Fund for a number of years.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&ldquo;We are proud to do our part now and in the future to help provide student athletes with a quality education that comes from the University of Idaho, and we hope others will do the same,&rdquo; Scott said.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
As a former student athlete, and with appreciation for the valuable education he received, Scott is joined by Maribeth in helping create a lifetime of memories for current and future students by investing in student athletes through the Vandal Scholarship Fund, where memberships become scholarships.

The first uses computer models to determine the implications of ongoing and possible future evolution in Ebola. The working group&rsquo;s second project also uses computer models &mdash; this time, to track how social, cultural and geographic factors affect the way Ebola spreads.&nbsp; In addition to providing long-term tools to help groups like the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention fight Ebola, the Ebola Working Group expects their research to provide techniques that will apply to other diseases.&nbsp;</td>

&nbsp;<br>
This weekend in Boise we celebrate a special milestone, the conclusion of the <em>Inspiring Futures: Invest in the University of Idaho</em> campaign. The donations from thousands of supporters &mdash; more than 45,000 &mdash; have made this campaign the largest fundraising effort in Idaho history. We have made a profound investment in the future &mdash; for students, for the discovery of knowledge, for the state of Idaho and for our world.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
We set a goal of $225 million to support four critical areas: student success, faculty excellence, world-class learning environments and innovative programs. The generosity of donors has allowed us to greatly exceed that initial goal, ending the campaign at an amazing total of $261 million.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The campaign&rsquo;s success results from the hard work of many committed individuals. Over seven-and-a-half years, dedicated men and women have tried to make a difference for Idaho&rsquo;s leading national research university. We can be especially grateful for the work of <span style=""color: #b18e5f;margin: 0px;padding: 0px;""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/inspire/stories/inspiring-leadership?utm_source=12315&utm_medium=email&utm_content=inspire_campaign-chairs&utm_campaign=friday-letter15"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">campaign co-chairs</a></span> Rich and Sharon Allen, and Jeff and Kristine Stoddard. These proud Vandals have offered leadership, perspective and inspiration, as well as financial contributions. In addition, countless Vandal staff members have gone above and beyond to communicate and execute the behind-the-scenes work of the campaign.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Of course, the lion&rsquo;s share of the credit goes to the 45,000 individuals and the many corporate and nonprofit partners who seized the opportunity to invest in a better future. One by one, these generous donations have added up to a powerful statement of belief in the excellence of the University of Idaho, and of our role in shaping the future for our world.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I keep using the word &ldquo;invest,&rdquo; and for good reason. We know that education is the key to our future. More than ever, supporting student success, including through scholarship support, means unlocking possibilities for our graduates, the next generation of leaders, doers and dreamers. Over the course of the <em>Inspiring Futures</em> campaign, supporters have created 153 new student scholarship endowments.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Furthermore, investing in teaching and research is a benefit for students, science and industry. With the help of 20 new faculty endowments, supported by individuals as well as organizations such as the <span style=""color: #b18e5f;margin: 0px;padding: 0px;""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/inspire/stories/Micron?utm_source=12315&utm_medium=email&utm_content=inspire_micron&utm_campaign=friday-letter15"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">Micron Technology Foundation</a></span>, we are poised to continue leading in one of our primary missions: the discovery and dissemination of knowledge.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Investing in our campus&rsquo; learning environments will also contribute to an inspired future at the University of Idaho. More than a dozen facilities are being renovated or newly constructed. Those investments complement the support of <span style=""color: #b18e5f;margin: 0px;padding: 0px;""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/ed/academics/Doceo-Center?utm_source=12315&utm_medium=email&utm_content=ed_doceo-center&utm_campaign=friday-letter15"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">student experiences and programs</a></span> that make a difference, from sustainable agriculture and natural resources to education and social sciences.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
This weekend we can look back with pride on these accomplishments, and we extend another warm thank you to the many donors who have made it possible. We can also look to the future, as the return on our shared investment comes back to us multiplied many times. This campaign is a success story whose chapters will be written in the lives of students, in advances in knowledge, and in opportunities and possibilities that benefit us all.&nbsp;</p>

            <span style=""margin:0px; padding:0px;"">Dear Friends,<br>
<br>
On Monday, I went before the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee (JFAC) of the Idaho Legislature to discuss our university&rsquo;s mission, activities and budget requests for the upcoming fiscal year. The governor has issued budget recommendations that would bolster many critical areas in our university&rsquo;s work for student success, for important research and for outreach and engagement.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The governor&rsquo;s top budget priority, one I share, is ensuring salary competitiveness for our hardworking faculty and staff by issuing a 3 percent, merit-based CEC (&ldquo;change in employee compensation&rdquo;). It is no secret that salaries at our institution have fallen behind our peer institutions, and turnover among our faculty and staff is a disruptive force. I have said it before, but it bears repeating: You can&rsquo;t buy loyalty, buy you can lose it &mdash; even Vandal loyalty. Salary competitiveness helps us recruit and retain the talented people who make our university excellent.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
In our higher education funding model, funding for salaries is split between the state and our institution&rsquo;s local sources of revenue. So a 3 percent CEC does create a funding obligation on our end &mdash; about $1.6 million. Were there an alternative revenue source to meet that funding need, we would be able to hold the line on student tuition and preserve access to a transformative University of Idaho education.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
A number of other requests represent a strong investment in programs that impact our students and our state:
<ul>
	<li>Funding for the Student Employee Readiness program (about $520,000) and programs that support the State Board&rsquo;s &ldquo;Complete College Idaho&rdquo; initiative (about $560,000) provide high-impact ways of helping students progress through their educations on-time, gain experiences with research and internships, and navigate career options for after college.</li>
	<br>
	<li>Support of UI&rsquo;s Agricultural Research and Extension Service (ARES) via a requested $1.5 million increase would help ARES continue to take a leading role in the success of Idaho agriculture, the largest sector of Idaho&rsquo;s economy.</li>
<br>
	<li>Funding for expanded capacity of the WWAMI program (about $670,000) is a step toward addressing a dramatic physician shortage in our state, especially in rural areas, by making sure Idaho residents have access to the top-ranked University of Washington medical school through UI. This funding would add five new seats (for a total of 35) and offer continued support to previously funded seats, helping progress toward the State Board&rsquo;s goal of 40 seats.</li>
	<br>
	<li>We are completing renovations on the Idaho Law and Justice Learning Center, and the governor has recommended $250,000 in what is effectively rent. The former Ada County Courthouse will be the home of our rapidly growing second- and third year law programs in Boise, and a welcome presence for the University of Idaho on the capital mall landscape.</li>
<br>
	<li>Support of the Forest Utilization Research program (about $220,000) is a recognition by the governor of the need to support a critical industry in our state and conduct important research to address challenges posed by wildfire and invasive species.</li>
</ul>
These recommendations provide a significant investment in our university&rsquo;s excellence, and we appreciate the governor&rsquo;s support of the university&rsquo;s needs.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Budget setting is a complex discussion between our institution, the governor, the State Board of Education and the legislature, as we partner together to achieve our shared goals for students and the state. That process will unwind over the next days, weeks and months. I&rsquo;ll continue to communicate with our partners, and to share with you the news on our priorities and requests as it develops.&nbsp;</span>

Linda &rsquo;62 &rsquo;65 and Bob &rsquo;64 Parkinson, of Jerome, Idaho, recently used securities they have held for decades to create a permanent endowment to support the dean of the College of Engineering. The Linda and Bob Parkinson Dean&rsquo;s Excellence Fund Endowment will provide much-needed support and a permanent revenue stream for programs within the College of Engineering to enhance student experiences and an ever-increasing list of priorities and needs.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&ldquo;As the world evolves and we are faced with new technological challenges, it is critical for the College of Engineering to adapt and continue to enhance our programs.&nbsp; This permanent endowment provides the flexibility for future deans to support students in new ways, spearhead new areas of faculty research, and keep our college in the forefront of engineering education in this country,&rdquo; said Dean Larry Stauffer.<br>

&nbsp;<br>
The research is significant because it nails down when the mountains existed: about 20 to 50 million years ago. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not the first people to say we think this area was higher than it is today, but we are the first to give absolute numbers, and determine when it was high,&rdquo; Cassell says.&nbsp;</td>

            <span style=""margin:0px; padding:0px;"">Dear Friends,<br>
&nbsp;<br>
This weekend my wife, Mary Beth, and I enjoyed skiing at Sun Valley. Standing on Mt. Baldy, gazing over the snow-capped mountains of Idaho reminded me that it has been nearly a year since we moved to Idaho. One of the joys of finding a new home has been discovering the amazing places and meeting the wonderful people in this great state.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Over the past year I&rsquo;ve made it a point to travel to every corner of the state and see the full spectrum of University of Idaho activity across Idaho. From our statewide Extension network to special places such as Taylor Ranch in the Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness, to our many Research and Extension Centers, the Vandal impact spreads far and wide in our state. During my bicycle tour of southern Idaho last summer, watching close-up mile after mile of agriculture and industry and visiting facilities, I realized that I&rsquo;d be hard-pressed to point to an Idaho community not in some way impacted by the success of UI programs, students, alumni and research.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
It really does bear repeating: As the Gem State&rsquo;s land-grant institution, Idaho is our 83,000 square mile campus.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The University of Idaho is a launching pad for eye-opening life experiences. For instance, students wishing to explore our state, learn new skills and meet new people can take advantage of the <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/studentaffairs/campus-recreation/outdoor-program?utm_source=2615&utm_medium=email&utm_content=outdoor-program&utm_campaign=friday-letter15"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">Outdoor Program</a></span>.&nbsp; Program staff put together clinics and workshops, offer cooperative and instructional trips, and run the Climbing Center on campus. Additionally, UI has a convenient <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/studentaffairs/campus-recreation/outdoor-program/rental-center?utm_source=2615&utm_medium=email&utm_content=outdoor-program_rental-center&utm_campaign=friday-letter15"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">rental center</a></span> with everything from camping gear to skis and snowboards to kayaks and canoes. They also tune and repair equipment.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Mary Beth and I have found the Outdoor Program the perfect place to assist our Idaho adventures. The abundance of the affordable and enriching opportunities led Outside magazine to name UI one of the <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://bit.ly/top-outdoor-universities"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">top 25 outdoor universities</a></span> in the country, and it&rsquo;s no wonder why.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Of course, there are also plenty of recreation options for Vandals inclined to stay close to home. <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/studentaffairs/campus-recreation?utm_source=2615&utm_medium=email&utm_content=campus-recreation&utm_campaign=friday-letter15"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">Campus Recreation</a></span> runs intramural sports, a wellness program, sports clubs and a number of other activities that provide exercise, personal growth and opportunities for camaraderie. There are top-notch facilities, including the Student Recreation Center, that add to the experience for our entire campus community. &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Idaho is a special place. The home campus in Moscow is situated in one of the country&rsquo;s most uniquely beautiful spots, with rivers and mountains that offer something to do and see in every season. I hope students and staff alike will get out there and explore our landscape. Wherever you are in this remarkable state, an Idaho adventure is waiting.</span>

The Minas-Hansen-Slavin Memorial Fund is used by the Dean of the College of Law to support programs and projects at the college. The class met this past September to celebrate their 50-year class reunion where members of the group renewed their support for the memorial fund, adding much-needed discretionary funds for use by the College of Law dean.

            <span style=""margin:0px; padding:0px;"">Dear Friends,<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The University of Idaho has long been an international institution. Since its founding, the university has provided students from beyond our shores with a first-class education. In turn, international students bring new perspectives, cultural traditions and opportunities for engagement to the university community.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Mary Beth and I have recently joined others in Moscow in the <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/international/intercultural-programs-events-and-activities/programs/friendshipfamilies?utm_source=21315&utm_medium=email&utm_content=ipo_friendship-families&utm_campaign=friday-letter15"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">&ldquo;Friendship Families&rdquo;</a></span> program &mdash; organized by the International Programs Office &mdash; which connects international students and scholars with local families. We&rsquo;ve gotten to know three students through this unique program. Marcelline, or &ldquo;Alex,&rdquo; is from France, by way of Sweden, and is studying marketing and entrepreneurship. Another student, Gayelle, is from Burkina Faso, and is studying architecture. Last but not least, Pavan hails from India, and is doing graduate work in electrical engineering.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
These students are having life-changing experiences at the University of Idaho, in everything from food to academics to recreational opportunities. Cuisine, of course, is a ready entry point into any culture, and one of the ways Mary Beth and I are coming together with our students is through sharing meals. Recently, a dinner of lentil soup and biscuits, conventional in the U.S. but unusual for our students, proved a great way to bond. In addition to new foods, our international students have made many adjustments, including a rigorous academic program, new friends, and even new patterns of daylight and nighttime for our close-to-the-equator students. We all enjoyed getting to know each other, even introducing two of our students to the game of pool.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
These one-on-one relationships make a big difference for generating understanding between people and helping students feel at home. Scaled up, these relationships help a cohort of students make the most of their time at the University of Idaho, and are a boon to the internationalization of our campus.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
In fall 2014, students at UI came from no fewer than 86 countries, all 50 states and Washington D.C., and several U.S. territories. A full 5 percent of undergraduates and 10 percent of graduate students come from abroad &mdash; a substantial international presence. However, we view that as a starting point, and continue to seek more international students at UI, as well as more opportunities for scholarship and research abroad <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/international/study-abroad?utm_source=21315&utm_medium=email&utm_content=ipo_study-abroad&utm_campaign=friday-letter15"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">for our American students</a></span>. Our university is affiliated with more than 370 universities in 69 countries, including 29 partnership universities. Thanks in some measure to a unique student-fee-funded scholarship, more than 15 percent of UI students graduate with study abroad experience. Study abroad and friendship families have been on our mind because our daughter, Rae, is spending winter quarter in Florence, Italy, studying Italian, art history and cooking. Her host family has welcomed her and enriched her experience tremendously. We will visit Italy in mid-March, meet them, and share Italy with Rae.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The diversity that internationalization brings is not just a benefit to our international students, but to our entire campus community. Learning from each other means understanding the rest of the world. Innovative ideas don&rsquo;t stop at our nation&rsquo;s borders, nor do opportunities for collaboration &hellip; and competition. To thrive in today&rsquo;s global economic landscape, students from abroad and from the U.S. need to interact with and learn from each other.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
We&rsquo;re looking forward to continuing to get to know our students in the months to come. And our university will continue to make progress in recruiting international students and connecting U.S. students with life-changing experiences abroad. For 125 years we have been Idaho&rsquo;s leading national research university, and will continue taking a leadership role on the global stage.</span>

Her strong belief in the importance of education has inspired her and husband, Jim, to give $20,000 toward the College of Education building renovation. The donation will support furnishing one of several private study/collaboration rooms in the Education building scheduled for completion in 2016. &ldquo;I feel strongly that students should have a healthy place to study that is quiet and without distractions,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I was impressed with the enthusiasm and dedication of the college&rsquo;s leadership in creating a safe, healthy learning environment for generations to come.&rdquo; Sandy&rsquo;s mother, Helen, instilled the fundamental value of education in Sandy and her three siblings, who all became teachers. To honor their mother they established the Rutledge Family Scholarship Endowment in 2009.<br>

Each year, thousands of participating students, community members and jazz fans visit the University of Idaho campus to take part in one of the country&rsquo;s most dynamic jazz festivals. Nationally acclaimed artists carry on the legacy of the legendary Lionel Hampton as they focus on connecting students with jazz education through intimate clinics, hands-on workshops and master classes. This year, organizers are excited to present another festival full of engaging workshops and vibrant evening concerts. Kickoff attendees will have the opportunity to view decades of commemorative posters displayed in the Chamber of Commerce and see the unveiling of the official commemorative poster designed for this year&rsquo;s celebration.</td>

            <span style=""margin:0px; padding:0px;"">Dear Friends,<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Next week I&rsquo;ll have the pleasure of attending my second <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/jazzfest?utm_source=22015&utm_medium=email&utm_content=jazz-fest&utm_campaign=friday-letter15"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival</a></span> in Moscow. Jazz Fest is a signature event for the University of Idaho, bringing together students of many ages, faculty and staff, and community members from all over. Mary Beth and I are looking forward to experiencing it together.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
What Jazz Fest does so well is combine the thrill of music and performance with the joy of teaching and learning. This year&rsquo;s lineup stands out, with <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/jazzfest/event-calendar/2015-artist-bios?utm_source=22015&utm_medium=email&utm_content=jazz-fest_artists&utm_campaign=friday-letter15"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">acclaimed artists</a></span> such as Diane Reeves, the Air Force&rsquo;s Airmen of Note ensemble, and many more. You&rsquo;d have to travel far to find a comparable lineup of jazz musicians together in one place. In fact, Yahoo Travel recently declared our festival the one <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://yhoo.it/17j8pqg"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t-Miss Event&rdquo;</a></span> in Idaho.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
But next week is about more than music. It&rsquo;s also an opportunity for education. In 2014, the Jazz in Schools program, a key piece of the festival, brought discovery through jazz to 42 area schools and 4,000 students. Many of those students will be on campus next week, as well, attending workshops and performing on the large stage. Jazz is collaborative improvisation, embodying an important life skill. Jazz musicians contribute to the whole through their instrument or talent, but not without listening, yielding the floor and participating in harmonies &mdash; sometimes leading, sometimes following, and together making something unique and beautiful.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Importantly, while students are practicing those skills, they&rsquo;ll also be getting a first-hand look at the university that we hope will be the setting for their college career. Not all of those students will be musicians or even study music, but it&rsquo;s inspiring to see how music and culture can help young people find their path.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Many honors have followed our University&rsquo;s work with students and our long history of amazing music. The festival has received the National Medal of the Arts award &mdash; the first instance of that award being bestowed upon a public university &mdash; and the Peter McGrath Community Engagement Exemplary Award, which recognized the innovative learning, discovery and engagement offered by the festival.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Of course, this event also celebrates the spirit and example of Lionel Hampton. More than just a musician, Lionel Hampton stood up for justice in our world, as a leader of one of the first integrated jazz bands and as an early supporter of South African leader Nelson Mandela. That heritage reminds us of the power of the <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/arts?utm_source=22015&utm_medium=email&utm_content=arts&utm_campaign=friday-letter15"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">arts</a></span> &mdash; and its accompanying public stage &mdash; to be a catalyst for positive change in the world. We are proud of our part in that legacy.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I hope to <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/jazzfest/tickets?utm_source=22015&utm_medium=email&utm_content=jazz-fest_tickets&utm_campaign=friday-letter15"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">see many of you</a></span> over the course of the week. Mary Beth and I will be taking in the music and enjoying seeing students learn and grow. And we&rsquo;ll be grateful for the behind-the-scenes work of festival staff, University of Idaho student workers and the small army of volunteers that help make this wonderful experience possible. Now in its 48th year, the Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival continues to thrive.</span>

            <span style=""margin:0px; padding:0px;"">Dear Friends,<br>
&nbsp;<br>
One full year into my presidency at the University of Idaho, I have been thinking about our mission of reaching students with a transformative education. How do we prepare graduates not just for careers, but for meaningful, engaged lives as employees, as community members and as citizens?<br>
&nbsp;<br>
We know that, on average, college graduates experience greater lifetime earnings than non-college graduates. However, those are relatively easy outcomes to measure. What they don&rsquo;t provide us is a well-rounded look at how postsecondary education contributes to someone&rsquo;s life. A <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://bit.ly/1AbCcaN"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">report by the Gallup organization</a></span>, together with Purdue University, sheds new light on what matters to graduates in their careers and overall lives. The results might also illuminate why Vandal students and alumni are so passionate about their experience at UI.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Gallup confirms that, primarily, students look to college as preparation for a good job. So what is a &ldquo;good&rdquo; job? The old adage is true: Money isn&rsquo;t everything. Gallup&rsquo;s holistic measurement of well-being finds that a good job is one where employees feel engaged. Engagement at work is the lynchpin for five different kinds of well-being: purpose well-being, social well-being, financial well-being, community well-being and physical well-being. The report finds that, &ldquo;If college graduates are engaged at work, the odds are nearly five times higher that they will be thriving in all five elements of well-being. The odds of thriving in all areas of well-being more than double for college graduates when they feel their college prepared them well for life outside of it.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
A person&rsquo;s experience in higher education makes a profound difference in their relationship to their <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""https://uidaho.emsicareercoach.com/?utm_source=22715&utm_medium=email&utm_content=career_finder=friday-letter15"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">future job and career</a></span>. A number of factors experienced in college contribute to landing a good job and arriving at a thriving well-being: a caring professor who made learning come alive; rewarding internships or jobs; active participation in extracurricular activities and organizations; and a chance to work on challenging, semester-long projects.<br>
<br>
UI excels in these areas. For instance, most undergraduates at UI have chances to participate in firsthand research, scholarly work and creative activity, often right at the side of <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/newsevents/features/launchbaugh-professor-of-the-year?utm_source=22715&utm_medium=email&utm_content=news-prof-of-the-year=friday-letter15"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">talented professors</a></span>. Our university&rsquo;s Career Center places students in internships and jobs that help them apply their knowledge and emerging skills. More than 200 student organizations, a robust intramural activities program, and a thriving Greek system mean abundant opportunities for relationship-building and personal growth.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Can we do more? Absolutely. A priority before the legislature right now is funding for a Student Employee Readiness program that will improve how we connect students with internships, research opportunities and job placement. We invested in an undergraduate research office this year. Beyond those initiatives, we need to listen to students, continue to improve the experiences we offer inside and outside of the classroom, and do a better job of connecting to our graduates to understand their success.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
As the state&rsquo;s leading national research university, we should be doing everything we can to position our students for success in a career and in life. One engaged graduate at a time, we&rsquo;ll contribute to a thriving well-being for our state and our world.</span>

            <span style=""margin:0px; padding:0px;"">Dear Friends,<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Just over a year ago, I became president of our leading, national research university. One of my first public events was the state finals of the <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://bit.ly/invent-idaho"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">Invent Idaho competition</a></span>, hosted here at the University of Idaho. It was a chance to watch the future of this state &mdash; its young people &mdash; imagine, design and build inventions that improve our world.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The imagination and ingenuity of the elementary and middle-school students who came to campus amazed me. Last year one of the &ldquo;Best of Show&rdquo; awards went to an elementary-school student who designed a &ldquo;seed board&rdquo; that protects seedlings in the ground. The other top award went to a middle-school student who designed a &ldquo;fast cast&rdquo; that can provide stability for an injured limb before a bumpy trip to a hospital &mdash; a fall from a horse and its uncomfortable aftermath proved the inspiration for that invention. Young inventors heard from Spokane&rsquo;s Brooke Martin, who won a similar competition in 2012 as an eighth-grader, moved her creation to Kickstarter and now <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://bit.ly/icpooch"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">has her product on the market</a></span>. (I am considering buying one to keep an eye on our three cats.) ICPooch is a video chat/remote feeder that improves pet behavior; it won second place in the 2015 Microsoft Small Business Contest.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Tomorrow the Invent Idaho competition is again <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/newsevents/item?name=invent-idaho-state-finals-come-to-ui-march-6-7&utm_source=3615&utm_medium=email&utm_content=news_invent-idaho-at-uidaho&utm_campaign=friday-letter15"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">held at the University of Idaho</a></span>. Nearly 150 finalists from elementary and middle school, as well as high school finalists from a new track of the competition, will converge on our campus. By the time you read this, many will already be here, touring UI and getting a firsthand look at laboratories and research space, with educational demonstrations from faculty and staff. This is a great chance for students to see what work in fields relevant to their inventions and their commercialization &mdash; that means everything from agriculture to engineering, and from architecture to education, as well as business &mdash; look like at our university, and to picture their ideas taking further shape at our institution, as Vandals.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I&rsquo;m especially interested in the theme of this year&rsquo;s competition, asking students to solve real-world problems, with a focus on helping other people. While they are using their talents to improve the lives of others, students are developing higher-level thinking processes and improving written communication skills with an &ldquo;inventor&rsquo;s journal&rdquo; that allows students to document the ups and downs of their journey in the competition. That&rsquo;s valuable experience and preparation for any young person, regardless of what field or career they eventually pursue.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Tomorrow, one of the winners of Invent Idaho will receive a $1,000 scholarship to the University of Idaho, and another winner will receive a free patent search, courtesy of sponsorship support, to see if their invention is patentable. But all the participants are winners. &nbsp;They&rsquo;ll have done something difficult &mdash; given life to a new idea, and had the confidence and maturity to put it out there for the world to see. &nbsp;&nbsp;Who knows? Maybe tomorrow we&rsquo;ll be introduced to the next Mark Zuckerberg, of Facebook fame, or the future Elizabeth Holmes of Theranos, a leading biotech company. Maybe one of our inventors is the next Vandal to take on space, like one of our own, Tom Mueller of SpaceX.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I can&rsquo;t wait to see what these bright young minds have invented &hellip; and also see as many as possible come to UI to fulfill their dreams.</span>

Heritage Society members are people who have provided for UI in their estate plans. Now married with a new baby, Emily says it&rsquo;s important to her that eventually some of what she&rsquo;s earned will benefit UI. &ldquo;I want to take care of my family, and Idaho is part of my family,&rdquo; explained Emily. As the oldest member of the Heritage Society, Dorothy Zaring, 104, will be making her estate gift to UI in memory of her late husband&#39;s parents, Roy and Mary Zaring. Dorothy and husband Joe &rsquo;42 were career foreign policy analysts and have supported UI&rsquo;s Martin Institute for decades.

            <span style=""margin:0px; padding:0px;"">Dear Friends,<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The groundhog may have seen his shadow, and it may technically still be winter for another week, but from where I sit, spring is in the air. That has me thinking ahead to enjoying the outdoors and getting to see more of this wonderful state &mdash; from the seat of a bicycle.<br>
<br>
Biking has always been something that my family has enjoyed. It offers a rewarding fitness challenge, whether trying to make it up a challenging hill or riding for a full day in the summer heat. It&rsquo;s also a great way to spend time with your thoughts, and to take in the scenery at a pace slow enough to really absorb the beauty around you.<br>
<br>
Mary Beth and I have found Idaho the perfect place to get out on a bike. In Moscow we&rsquo;ve taken advantage of the Bill Chipman Palouse Trail, uniting Moscow and Pullman. We&rsquo;ve also explored the Trail of the Coeur d&rsquo;Alenes, a short trek north of Moscow. And last summer we were thrilled to be joined by many Vandals in volunteering at Ironman Coeur d&rsquo;Alene, which the university helped sponsor (and will sponsor again in 2015).<br>
<br>
Last summer I also had the opportunity to participate in the <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://bit.ly/1MwHaYG"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">Ride Idaho</a></span> bike tour. Starting in Twin Falls, the tour went to the City of Rocks, to Sun Valley and back to Twin Falls. I rode the first three days, and was accompanied by Guillermo Odorica, head of the Mexican Consulate in Boise, and other UI leaders and alumni. We enjoyed the natural splendor of southern Idaho. Mile after mile, community after community, the Vandal impact was everywhere &mdash; in facilities, projects and people. The state of Idaho truly is our campus.<br>
<br>
So for this year&rsquo;s Ride Idaho event, what better way to see our campus &mdash; our state &mdash; than by bicycle, among fellow Vandals? This year&rsquo;s route starts in Coeur d&rsquo;Alene, home to <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/cda?utm_source=31315&utm_medium=email&utm_content=CDA&utm_campaign=friday-letter15"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">one of UI&rsquo;s statewide centers</a></span>. A quick boat cruise on Lake Coeur d&rsquo;Alene will have us start our journey by bike on the Trail of the Coeur d&rsquo;Alenes. We&rsquo;ll ride east in the ensuing days, including a segment on the Hiawatha Trail. After a jaunt through western Montana, in North Idaho we&rsquo;ll pass Moyie Springs, where UI partnered on the Kootenai Tribe&rsquo;s new <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://bit.ly/1BxMt6C"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">burbot aquaculture program</a></span>, before heading south through Bonner&rsquo;s Ferry and Sandpoint to close the loop at Coeur d&rsquo;Alene.<br>

This year, I&rsquo;m hoping many of our University of Idaho alumni and friends can join us for Ride Idaho. Bike trips like this are opportunities for camaraderie. I have many fond memories of last year&rsquo;s event, meeting new people and renewing friendships both on and off the bike seat. Last year our rendition of the Vandal Fight Song won &ldquo;Dead Last&rdquo; in the Ride Idaho talent contest, and the trophy sits on my shelf. This year I&rsquo;m hoping that we get a few more folks together and make a better showing!<br>
<br>
Registration is now open, and if you&rsquo;re able to make the trip, the university will provide free University of Idaho riding jerseys and hats to UI-affiliated participants. This is a fun way to make a strong statement that North Idaho is truly Vandal country. Check out the Ride Idaho website, and contact our <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/alumni?utm_source=31315&utm_medium=email&utm_content=alumni&utm_campaign=friday-letter15"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">Office of Alumni Relations</a></span> for more details about the jersey and UI participation. I look forward to exploring Vandal country together.<br>

            <span style=""margin:0px; padding:0px;"">Dear Friends,<br>
&nbsp;<br>
For many students, Spring Break is a time for rest and relaxation. But nearly 100 Vandal students have been taking a different kind of break from their studies this week. Fanned out in communities across Idaho, Wyoming, Washington, Montana and Oregon, they&rsquo;ve been volunteering through the university&rsquo;s <span style=""color:#b18e5f""> <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/studentaffairs/department-of-student-involvement/center-for-volunteerism-and-social-action/alternative-service-breaks?utm_source=32015&utm_medium=email&utm_content=student-affairs_student-involvement_asb&utm_campaign=friday-letter15"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">Alternative Service Break (ASB) program</a></span>.<br>
<br>
Alternative Service Breaks are opportunities for students &mdash; from freshman to graduate level &mdash; to get involved in positive, collaboration-centered extracurricular activities. Students broaden their social groups and engage with people they might not otherwise have met. A student from rural Idaho might work together on a project with a student from the East Coast, or from South America, or from Africa.<br>
<br>
While working with fellow students, ASB participants gain insight about communities from outside their world experience. Each ASB group partners with a local organization with a proven track record of sustainable impact: a rescue mission in Boise, conservation-focused groups in the Pacific Northwest, an organization that provides no-cost repairs for seniors in need in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, for example. This mission of partnership ensures that change is meaningful and long-lasting; it also lets students get to know and learn from community members, whom they work alongside.<br>
<br>
Alternative Service Break students are also developing leadership skills. Student coordinators take on the lion&rsquo;s share of trip planning, and student leaders of each of the nine separate ASB groups this spring have worked with partner organizations in communities, planned trip details and communicated with their groups. In a program by students, for students and led by students, ASB participants gain practical skills with real-world applications.<br>
<br>
These are experiences that our Vandal students seek out on their own. The program strives to make the trips affordable, including through a <span style=""color:#b18e5f""> <a href=""https://www.sites.uidaho.edu/giving/givingform.aspx?giftid=MF237&utm_source=32015&utm_medium=email&utm_content=giving-form_asb&utm_campaign=friday-letter15"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">pool of need-based support</a></span>, as the two-week national and international trips in ASB&rsquo;s winter program, for instance, cannot help but be a financial stretch for many students.<br>
<br>
I&rsquo;m very proud of our ASB students. They represent our university with pride, and with the passion for service that all Vandals aspire to. They are the leaders, not just of tomorrow, but of today.<br>
<br>
So if you see some tanned, enthusiastic students next week, remember, they may not have come straight from the beach. They may have been building a house out in the sun, or clearing a trail or helping a senior in need. And they are heading right back to their schoolwork, their student organizations and their many other commitments. They&rsquo;ll have earned a little rest &mdash; not that they&rsquo;ll take it.<br>

<hr><br>
Dear Friends,<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Starting at our main campus on the Palouse, in Nez Perce ancestral lands, the University of Idaho has always been a place where cultures converge, and where we grow stronger by learning from each other and sharing perspectives and traditions. The annual <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/nativeamericancenter/tutxinmepupowwow?utm_source=32715&utm_medium=email&utm_content=native-american-student-center_annual-powwow&utm_campaign=friday-letter15"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">Tutxinmepu Powwow</a></span>, occurring next weekend, April 4-5, in Moscow, is a great example of the thriving cultural traditions embraced at UI. Powwows are occasions to gather and pass on traditions and teachings &mdash; similar, in a very broad sense, to a university mission. We now have an opportunity to enhance that mission.<br>
<br>
The <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/nativeamericancenter?utm_source=32715&utm_medium=email&utm_content=native-american-student-center-home&utm_campaign=friday-letter15"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">Native American Student Center</a></span> and the Native American Student Association put together the two-day powwow. I was able to attend last year, and this year I&rsquo;ll have the honor of participating in the grand entry and other events. The public is welcome, and whether attendees volunteer or just take in the fun, it&rsquo;s a showcase for the vibrant Native cultures in our region. Prospective students participating in the powwow also have the chance to experience our campus and Moscow, seeing what a great atmosphere our university community has to offer.<br>
<br>
The Native American Student Center is at the heart of student life for many Native students. I&rsquo;m proud of the role that the center plays in their UI experience. It&rsquo;s a place to find academic, cultural and social support &mdash; to study and grow as students, to share interests and activities, and to hang out with friends and classmates. I know many talented leaders and future professionals are emerging out of the center and the Native American Student Association.<br>
<br>
At an organizational level, a memorandum of understanding (MOU) strengthens UI&rsquo;s relationship with nearby tribes. The tribes who have come together in this agreement participate in the President&rsquo;s Native American Advisory Council, which seeks unity and cooperation among Native American students, signatory tribes and UI. A complementary Advisory Board meets twice a year and provides feedback on the development of curriculum, the recruitment and retention of Native American students, and the provision of support services and educational programs. We recently welcomed the Yakama Nation as the 10th signatory to this memorandum of understanding, and I&rsquo;m very glad we can partner with them on higher education issues and work together to support student success.<br>
<br>
I know that right away we can do more for more students. So after extensive deliberation with UI&rsquo;s <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/provost/tribal-relations?utm_source=32715&utm_medium=email&utm_content=tribal-relations&utm_campaign=friday-letter15"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">Office of Tribal Relations</a></span>, tribal leaders and others, I have decided that enrolled members of MOU tribes and transfer students from tribal colleges will be eligible for in-state, undergraduate tuition rates at the University of Idaho. Some aboriginal elders and indigenous scholars have described post-secondary education as the &ldquo;new buffalo,&rdquo; a sustaining resource for individual and community-wide empowerment. We embrace facilitating that goal for students. In neighboring states, institutions in tribes&rsquo; traditional and customary ranges similarly partner with tribes to support access to post-secondary education.<br>
<br>
It is my hope that access to one of the best values in higher education will make UI the college of choice for more tribal members. It is my firm belief that we will be taking important steps in building a more diverse, culturally responsive and outstanding University of Idaho for all people.<br>

Together, the schools plan to graduate more than 20,000 formally recognized &ldquo;Grand Challenge Engineers&rdquo; over the next decade. &ldquo;The UI Grand Challenge Scholars program will focus on five key elements: hands-on experience related to a Grand Challenge, interdisciplinary curriculum, entrepreneurship, global complexity and service learning,&rdquo; said Larry Stauffer, dean of Engineering. &ldquo;The goal is to graduate over 200 Grand Challenge Engineers from the UI by 2025 who are prepared with the unique combination of skills, motivation and leadership to address the Grand Challenges.&rdquo;</td>

            <span style=""margin:0px; padding:0px;"">Dear Friends,<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Our university is a leader in many areas: teaching and learning, research, and community outreach. In addition, we play another important role, as a facilitator for dialogue about important issues facing our world. Several upcoming forums serve as great examples of our commitment to serving and strengthening the public discourse.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I&rsquo;d like to invite you to join the conversation at the upcoming <span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/class/borah/borah-2015-schedule?utm_source=4315&utm_medium=email&utm_content=borah-2015&utm_campaign=friday-letter15"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">Borah Symposium</a></span>, held in Moscow April 6-8. The Borah Foundation, supported by the Martin Institute, has put together a stimulating program on &ldquo;Troubled Borders: Sovereignty, War, Disease and Refugees.&rdquo; Many highly regarded experts on public policy in these areas will present a range of ideas over the three days.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I&rsquo;m looking forward to engaging presentations on healthcare and refugees in Idaho, climate change issues, global medical emergencies, and more. And I&rsquo;m happy to welcome to campus the many participants from far and wide, including James Hill, the consul general of Canada in Seattle, and Guillermo Ordorica, the consul of Mexico in Boise, who will serve as panelists. The Borah Symposium concludes with a keynote address by scholar and author Dr. Thomas Barnett. I suspect that Senator William Borah, the &ldquo;Lion of Idaho,&rdquo; would be impressed with the breadth and depth of this year&rsquo;s symposium.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
We had also been anticipating the annual Sherman J. Bellwood Lecture, a signature event in the College of Law that provides opportunities for students and the community to engage with leading minds in the justice system. Originally slated for next week, we unfortunately&nbsp;<span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/newsevents/item?name=annual-sherman-j-bellwood-memorial-lecture-series-postponed-50413&utm_source=4315&utm_medium=email&utm_content=news_bellwood-postponed&utm_campaign=friday-letter15"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">have had to postpone the event</a></span> until a later date due to a health-related conflict. I wish Juan Guzm&aacute;n &mdash; the much-admired, Chilean former justice who had planned to present at the lecture &mdash; all the best for a speedy recovery.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
A wide array of other public events take place throughout the year at UI, including the Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival, the annual Hemingway Festival, the McClure Center lectures and many more. And just as you don&rsquo;t need to be a jazz musician to appreciate the Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival, you don&rsquo;t need to be a lawyer to enjoy the Bellwood lectures, or be an international relations expert to gain insight and perspective from the Borah Symposium. These events are about people coming together, bringing their own interests and experiences, to learn about topics that affect us all. They are about an engaged and informed citizenry exercising fundamental virtues &mdash; learning, discussing and applying new ideas and information.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
We are Idaho&rsquo;s leading national research university, and the hard work of many faculty, staff, students and volunteers means that we are also a leader in shaping the discourse in our state. These are much-needed discussions about our shared history, contemporary concerns and future vision. I hope you&rsquo;ll join us at these upcoming events, and participate in the conversation that makes us, for all our differences, a more united and a more educated citizenry.</span>

The alliance supports a number of services, including a next-generation Shared Integrated Library System; collaborative technical services program including shared e-book ownership; Summit, a system that allows students, faculty and staff to easily search and request library materials owned by member libraries; and Northwest Digital Archives, offering enhanced access to primary sources. These services simplify the research process and promote the success of students, faculty, staff and researchers.</td>

            <span style=""margin:0px; padding:0px;"">Dear Friends,<br>
&nbsp;<br>
You&rsquo;ll often hear me refer to the University of Idaho as our state&rsquo;s &ldquo;leading national research university.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a way of describing our university as defined, at least in part, by the scale and influence of our research, scholarly activity and creative work. Across the state of Idaho and beyond, UI research delivers a transformative impact, addressing critical problems and discovering new knowledge.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<span style=""color:#b18e5f""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/research/about-research/2015-research-report?utm_source=41015&utm_medium=email&utm_content=research-report-2015&utm_campaign=friday-letter15"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">&ldquo;Inspired Discoveries,&rdquo;</a></span> our newest annual research report hot off the press, showcases some of the groundbreaking research at UI. You&rsquo;ll read about important projects at the Aquaculture Research Institute in Moscow and Hagerman, where scientists are developing trout that thrive on plant-based diets and developing vaccines to ward against bacterial infections &mdash; major advancements for a crucial industry. In southeastern Idaho, the Idaho National Laboratory and UI psychology students at the Center for Advanced Energy Studies are using an immersive simulator to study efficiency, safety and communications on heavy-vehicle systems. Another exciting project looks at ways to design prostheses that work with the body&rsquo;s neuromuscular system to minimize pain and enhance movement, a potential leap forward for millions in such need.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Research at UI supports &mdash; and is supported by &mdash; industry partners. Those relationships help foster economic development and opportunity. In order to facilitate better access to research, we&rsquo;ve revamped our intellectual property policies. You&rsquo;ll read about the immediate effects of those changes, including a new project with Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories that will help utility companies plan for and respond to disturbances on the power grid.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Other much-needed and appreciated industry connections include relationships with Potlatch Corporation to study modern forest practices, with J.R. Simplot Co. at the Parma Research and Extension Center, and with Micron at the UI Business Process Center, where student teams partner with companies to solve real-world problems. In addition, our emerging dairy initiative, the Western Initiative on the Dairy Environment (WIDE), will help dairies adapt and grow in a complex environment for producers and processers.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
There are many other great projects, partnerships and developments highlighted in the report. I hope you&rsquo;ll look through it and spread the word about stories that catch your interest. I also hope you&rsquo;ll tune in next week when we&rsquo;ll share with the world an exciting new research grant that will position us as leaders in complex system modeling.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The nearly $100 million in annual research expenditures demonstrates the powerful breadth and depth of UI research. But research funding only tells part of the story &mdash; the scholarship and creative excellence found across colleges and programs is outstanding. I am proud of the hard work and passion of all our talented researchers, our motivated students and our invaluable staff members who are helping UI continue to grow as our state&rsquo;s research leader.&nbsp;</span>

            <span style=""margin:0px; padding:0px;"">Dear Friends,<br>
<br>
This week the State Board of Education <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/newsevents/item?name=board-of-regents-approve-ui-student-tuition-and-fee-increase "" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">approved a 3.5 percent increase</a> in undergraduate, resident tuition and fees at the University of Idaho. The increase supports the quality of our academic experience. I am also very aware the increase will have an impact on current and prospective students and their families. As our state&rsquo;s leading national research university, we walk a tightrope between maintaining quality and providing access to an affordable education.<br>
<br>
We clearly needed to invest in employee compensation. Faculty and staff salaries have fallen far behind peer and regional averages. Simply put, we have been losing or failing to attract the talented teachers, researchers and support staff who make UI a premier institution and a great value. This tuition and fees increase &mdash; the lowest in 10 years, following the second-lowest last year &mdash; will allow us to fully fund the Idaho Legislature&rsquo;s 3 percent salary increase and invest in our excellence.<br>
<br>
It is always our goal to keep our university affordable. A college education is a transformative experience, and our foremost priority is to make that experience possible. College-educated professionals are also the key to the future of Idaho, shaping our economic development and contributing to industries and organizations that make our state great. The State Board of Education&rsquo;s 60 percent post-secondary attainment by 2020 goal recognizes the power of a college degree, and we are committed to doing our part.<br>
<br>
Our university works hard to maintain access to a world-class education. New initiatives include changes in our <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/financialaid/scholarships/idaho-resident-scholarships "" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">Go Idaho! scholarships</a> for Idaho residents and our Discover Idaho scholarships for out-of-state students. High school students with a 3.0 GPA now qualify for merit-based support, in addition to other scholarships for which they might qualify. We know those students can succeed at our university. Aid opportunities like that are part of the more than $20 million in support that the University of Idaho makes available to students every year, often with the help of generous donors.<br>
<br>
I know that for many students and families, paying for college can seem daunting, with yearly costs, the prospect of debt and a return on investment that may appear far in the future. Many of our undergraduates, 36 percent, are among the first generation in their family to attend college. But higher education is absolutely the right decision, and UI offers unmatched value. A new financial literacy program (&ldquo;Better Education about Money for Students,&rdquo; or &ldquo;BEAMS&rdquo;) we&rsquo;re putting together this fall will offer financial literacy counseling, including information about how debt figures into long-term financial plans. (The average student debt of $26,700 at UI, by the way, falls below the national average.) We are ready and willing to try ideas that make a difference for our students.<br>
<br>
Students graduate from the University of Idaho prepared to meet financial challenges &mdash; the average starting and mid-career earnings of a Vandal grad are <a href=""https://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report-2014/full-list-of-schools "" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">well above</a> those from other Idaho institutions. College graduates not only earn an average of $830,000 more than those without a degree, Gallup polling shows that they also enjoy improved individual well-being and many positive social outcomes. Just as they have for more than 125 years, students can come to the University of Idaho confident that they are making a long-term investment in their future, and certain that we are assisting them by keeping college affordable and manageable.</span>

            <span style=""margin:0px; padding:0px;"">Dear Friends,<br>
<br>
As we approach the end of another great academic year, it&rsquo;s worth reflecting on the excellence achieved by our Vandal students. Our first priority, after all, is facilitating student success. Though we celebrate each student&rsquo;s graduation or achievement, some of our students have received national recognition for their efforts. In this letter, I would like to specifically recognize several recent winners of prestigious national scholarships.<br>
<br>
This year, again, the best and brightest from across the region made the University of Idaho their choice to pursue their dreams, as 23 new freshman National Merit Scholars enrolled at our state&rsquo;s leading national research university. They joined a cohort that matches last year&rsquo;s school record of 76 total National Merit Scholars. Earning a National Merit Scholarship is a rigorous process. We can be proud these students have chosen our university to prepare them for career and life success.<br>
<br>
Many Vandals have been honored with national scholarships this year. Recently, Benjamin Anzis, a sophomore from Marshalltown, Iowa, and Elyce Gosselin, a sophomore from Boise, received prestigious <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/newsevents/item?name=two-ui-sophomores-selected-as-goldwater-scholars&utm_source=42415&utm_medium=email&utm_content=news_goldwater-scholars&utm_campaign=friday-letter15"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">Goldwater Scholarships</a>, supporting research careers in science, mathematics and engineering. Since 2005, 12 Vandal students have received this award. This year&rsquo;s winners are already contributing to the discovery and application of knowledge in new and exciting ways, and I congratulate them on having their success recognized.

<br>
 Other students are contributing to UI&rsquo;s global impact as recipients of the <a href=""http://bit.ly/1EwEmdO"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">Benjamin A. Gilman Scholarship</a>, given by the U.S. Department of State. These competitive scholarships &mdash; only 800 are awarded nationwide &mdash; allow students the opportunity to study and intern abroad with financial support. Our two students, Marley Monroe and William Humble, studying psychology and civil engineering, respectively, will be exposed to enriching academic, social and cultural experiences, and they&rsquo;ll return to UI able to share that information and understanding.<br>
<br>
I congratulate the <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/honors?utm_source=42415&utm_medium=email&utm_content=honors&utm_campaign=friday-letter15"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">University Honors Program</a> at UI for facilitating many of these scholarships. The Honors Program offers a stimulating academic experience and the advantages of an enhanced learning community to approximately 500 students from all colleges and undergraduate majors. The Honors Program provides enriching classes; a motivated, challenging and scholarly peer group; and mentoring for getting involved in undergraduate research, leadership development, volunteerism and personal development. In addition, we have recently added specific staff support to further mentor students toward prestigious national awards.<br>
<br>
Undoubtedly, I&rsquo;ve failed to mention some outstanding students, programs and accolades. That&rsquo;s a testament to the abundant talent and initiative of students across disciplines at UI. I also want to make it clear: We value the achievement of all students at UI. There are many contributions to the classroom environment, to student organizations, to valuable programs and to the community that aren&rsquo;t always measured with awards. But I know that Vandals across our campus &mdash; across the state of Idaho, that is &mdash; are embracing achievement in many ways, and preparing well for rich and full lives within their professions, their communities and their families.<br>

            <span style=""margin:0px; padding:0px;"">Dear Friends,<br>
<br>
My first visit to a university was when my father took me to an engineering expo at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. The experience left a lasting impression. My eyes were opened to a world of innovation, imagination and problem-solving — all available and accessible through higher education. Here were people working on real solutions to real challenges … and I could be one of them. Eventually, I attended the University of Illinois as an undergraduate, and I did become a STEM graduate.<br>
<br>
Today middle- and high-school students from across the Inland Northwest are descending on Moscow in search of similar experiences at the College of Engineering’s 22nd annual <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/engr/events/expo"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">Engineering Design EXPO</a>. This year more than 900 students — a cohort three times the size of previous years — have come to our campus to participate in the day’s events. They’ll see firsthand the exciting research and designs created by more than 250 Vandal students collaborating in more than 50 interdisciplinary teams.<br>
<br>
Expo serves as the capstone for graduating seniors in the College of Engineering. This year our Vandal engineering students have again been working on <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/engr/expo/expo-videos"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">amazing projects</a>, everything from improving wastewater systems, to enhancing the rehabilitation of stroke victims, to guiding payloads back from space. In those and many other cases, students work on projects that directly impact industry, searching for new or better solutions to specific challenges. Projects are often further developed for real-world applications.<br>
<br>
At the expo, students also practice skills essential in any endeavor: putting an idea out there and effectively communicating its function and value. More than 60 judges representing industry and other professional sectors are on hand to contribute valuable feedback. Their participation and the support of the Micron Foundation, the event’s presenting sponsor, and many other sponsors and partners makes this day possible.<br>
<br>
Recently, the UI College of Engineering became the only engineering school in Idaho to join the <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/newsevents/item"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">“Grand Challenges”</a> project. Our school has pledged to do its part to help train 20,000 engineers nationwide who can take on critical goals such as clean energy, advances in medicine and cybersecurity. Today’s Engineering Design EXPO puts us in position to show we’re addressing some of these issues.<br>
<br>
But for prospective students, this is an opportunity to see how they can make an impact in the world. If our visiting secondary students are anything like I was at their age, they’ll come away from the day energized about their futures. Not every student will go on to study engineering, of course, but they’ll have a glimpse of the stimulating work that occurs at UI, and they’ll see a campus where they can find their own path forward among friends, dedicated faculty and supportive staff, and abundant opportunities.</span>

Valued at more than $231,000 per year, the grant is renewable for a third year. The funds will support development of classroom, laboratory and structured on-the-job training curriculum, as well as a laboratory facility. Early in the first year, funds will also support instructors. The program is designed to become self-sustaining as enrollments increase over time. The university partnered with Fatbeam, Idaho Power, Kootenai Health and Highpoint Medical to propose a statewide program offering concentrated short-term training and certification exams to information technology professionals with at least two to four years of work experience who need additional training to perform security analyst work. The program has the capacity to train nearly 500 students during the first two years, and plans to train and certify workers from Idaho and throughout the nation.</td>

            <span style=""margin:0px; padding:0px;"">Dear Friends,<br>
<br>
Nearly one year ago today, I happened to be at the airport in Louisville, Kentucky, more than 2,100 miles from Moscow. I had been president of the University of Idaho for a little over a month, and was decked out in a still-new Vandals cap. From behind me, I heard someone sing a refrain that had already become a favorite of mine: “Came a tribe from the North, brave and bold. …” I’d been spotted, by a stranger, one who was unafraid to break into the Vandal fight song in a crowded airport. It was a stirring welcome to the unabashedly passionate Vandal alumni family.<br>
<br>
The Vandal alumni network of more than 100,000 people may be separated by years, professions and sometimes many miles. But all are united by a passion for the University of Idaho. The energy and enthusiasm of our alumni help our university continue to thrive, and their personal and professional distinction verifies the transformative impact of a Vandal education.<br>
<br>
Next week we <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/alumni/awards?utm_source=50815&utm_medium=email&utm_content=alumni-awards&utm_campaign=friday-letter15"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">honor several outstanding Vandal alumni</a>. Kristin Armstrong Savola receives our rarely bestowed Distinguished Idahoan award, recognizing the great distinction she has brought to the state and to UI; Kristin won two Olympic gold medals in cycling, most recently in the 2012 London summer games. We also honor Keith Riffle, a gifted technology entrepreneur, who receives the President’s Medallion; Patricia Riffle, a longtime participant in many Vandal causes, who earns an Alumni of Distinction Award; and Brent Keeth, a leader in the computer technology industry and co-principle developer on Micron’s Hybrid Memory Cube, who receives an honorary degree.<br>
<br>
We’ll also induct three very deserving members into our <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/alumni/awards/halloffame"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">Alumni Hall of Fame</a>. Richard Dahl has had a remarkable career, including a tenure as president of Dole Food Company. David Poe, as CEO of financial services firm Edgar Dunn and Company, helped develop e-commerce and mobile payment solutions. David is joined by Michael Hunter, who has an accomplished career as an energy sector executive. All three offer their service on the University of Idaho Foundation Inc. board of directors.<br>
<br>
Many alumni have given back generously to the university, helping us successfully complete the largest fundraising campaign in the history of Idaho. In addition to that support, alumni share their time and talents in other ways: helping students with internships, encouraging students to attend UI, and championing the university with their friends and in their communities.<br>
<br>
One of the fun things about the end of spring semester is that it is packed with chances to connect with our alumni, seeing them come back to campus as speakers, as award winners and as parents of Vandal graduates. I’ve had the opportunity to watch fifth- and even sixth-generation Vandals receive degrees. That’s a powerful statement about our role in the state of Idaho, our continued vibrancy as an institution and our forward-looking vision for the future.<br>
<br>
As one final note, we tragically lost a Vandal family member this week when Sergeant Greg Moore, a 16-year veteran of the Coeur d’Alene Police Department, was killed in the line of duty. Sergeant Moore was a member of the Vandal class of 1997. We mourn his passing, and respect and honor his selfless dedication to public service and to the city of Coeur d’Alene. Our thoughts are with his family and the Coeur d’Alene community.</span>

They believe strongly in the importance of educational opportunity and the benefits of healthy eating and physical activity on life-long achievement,” said Karianne Fallow, CEO of the United Dairymen of Idaho. “The program backing we provide aligns well with those principles.” For more information, contact Kim O’Neill, CALS assistant dean of advancement, at 208-885-8606 or <a href=""mailto:kimoneill@uidaho.edu"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">kimoneill@uidaho.edu</a>.</td>

Brooking’s new value added ranking considers graduate success based on three economic measures: midcareer earnings, occupational earnings power (the average salary of occupations alumni have) and student-loan repayment. UI graduates performed the best on all three outcomes against any other public four-year institution in Idaho, and UI was near the top of the pack in the Northwest, as well. UI’s scores on each measure, where 100 is the highest score possible, are midcareer earnings = 84, occupational earnings power = 96, and student-loan repayment = 61. Value-added rankings measure the difference between actual alumni outcomes (like salaries) and the outcomes one would expect given a student’s characteristics and the type of institution. That calculation determines the portion of alumni success that can be attributed specifically to the college.</td>

            <span style=""margin:0px; padding:0px;"">Dear Friends,<br>
<br>
This weekend in Moscow, we come together to celebrate the success of our Vandal graduates. Statewide this spring, more than 1,500 students have officially become degree-bearing University of Idaho alumni. They represent the many excellent academic programs at UI, earning baccalaureate, master’s, doctoral, law and specialist degrees. These outstanding students have run a long race, and our entire university community can be proud of them for reaching the finish line.<br>
<br>
I’m thrilled that these Vandals chose our leading, national research university to prepare them for the rest of their lives. Students will take the problem-solving, critical thinking and technical skills they’ve honed here to strengthen their chosen professions and help move our nation and world forward. Just as importantly, Vandal graduates have practiced the values of citizenship and service that will provide personal enrichment and enable valuable contributions to communities near and far. That experience will pay off — Vandals experience personal and <a href=""https://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report/bachelors"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">professional success</a> that <a href=""https://www.brookings.edu/research/beyond-college-rankings-a-value-added-approach-to-assessing-two-and-four-year-schools/"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">compares favorably</a> with some of the best institutions in our region and our country.<br>
<br>
I am proud that our institution is in a position to facilitate that success. Throughout the course of their time here, our talented faculty and staff have offered students unique opportunities, personal mentoring and dynamic instruction to prepare them for a 21st-century workforce in a global economy. And graduates have taken advantage, overcoming challenges and exercising great personal initiative to make the most of their time as a student. (You can read some of their <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/feature-stories?utm_source=51515&utm_medium=email&utm_content=news-feature_stories&utm_campaign=friday-letter15"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank""> inspiring stories here</a>.)<br>
<br>
Education is not a one-way street; students are not empty vessels receiving revealed wisdom. Education is a partnership. The university has been enriched by the boundless creativity and energy of our students. I can’t wait to see what these students do once their tassels have been turned to the other side of their mortar boards.<br>
<br>
In life, though, the finish line has a way of moving back. As the term “commencement” suggests, this is the end of formal education, but really just the beginning for our students. They walk across the stage into an exciting future that is theirs to shape. Our graduates can be confident that they have the support of an energized and supportive Vandal family, and an institution that is proud to call them its alumni. As they receive their well-earned diplomas, they have new races to run, but I know that they will find success in each step on that path.</span>

He will also serve as a visiting researcher on a team studying how additives change the properties of fluids to optimize engineering systems in order to make them more efficient. As part of the program Crepeau will have the opportunity to travel throughout Ecuador visiting other universities to discuss his teaching, research and the University of Idaho as a Fulbright ambassador. “This is a unique opportunity for an engineer,” Crepeau said. “We tend to get focused in our discipline.

A <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/newsevents/item"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">new study</a> from the University of Idaho and the University of Michigan unearths how these economically valuable deposits are distributed around the world. The research, <a href=""http://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo2429"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">published in Nature Geosciences online</a>, indicates that climate helps drive the erosion process that exposes porphyry copper deposits, as well as helps determine where on Earth the deposits form. The study was conducted by Brian Yanites, an assistant professor in the UI Department of Geological Sciences, and Stephen Kesler, an emeritus professor in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at Michigan. “This is the first time that we’ve found a connection between geomorphology and economic geology,” Yanites says. “It’s exciting to think that erosion and the building of our mountain landscapes influences where society gets its resources from, and it’s another line of evidence of the importance of climate in the shape of the landscape.”</td>

<br>
As Idaho’s leading, national research institution, the University of Idaho helps drive economic growth by taking on research in key areas and by preparing graduates for success in science, technology, education and math (STEM). As part of that mission, this week we were pleased to bring scientist, entrepreneur and policy expert <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/boise/calendar/presidential-keynote-speaker/bio"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">Dr. Ed Penhoet</a> to UI Boise. Dr. Penhoet is the founder of Chiron Corporation, a biotechnology company that developed the world’s first recombinant DNA-based vaccine (for Hepatitis B), isolated Hepatitis C and developed the test used to prevent contamination of blood transfusions with that virus. I was privileged to work at Chiron in 1985 and 1986. It was a formative time for me as a researcher, but the experience also provided valuable lessons on how one’s work can have an impact that benefits the world.<br>

Dr. Penhoet’s distinguished resume also includes service as dean of the University of California, Berkeley’s School of Public Health; leadership of the Gordon and Betty Moore (Intel) Foundation; and success as a venture capitalist. He is also an appointee to President Obama’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, or PCAST. That group, comprised of some of our nation’s leading scientists and engineers, reports to the president with recommendations on how science, technology and innovation can inform policy and contribute to a robust economy. PCAST has published two reports on the role of STEM education to ensure our nation’s long-term economic success.<br>
<br>
Dr. Penhoet addressed education and community leaders during the closing event Tuesday for the UI-Micron STEM education conference. He described PCAST’s recommendations for improving STEM education, lauding the K-12 educators at the conference for their efforts, encouraging them to continue to work on improving math preparation and science engagement, and reminding the university community of our responsibility to keep engaging students after they enroll.<br>
<br>
On Wednesday in the Zions Bank meeting room, Dr. Penhoet gave a keynote speech to an audience of business and community leaders about developing our biotechnology industry. He drew on his experience with Chiron and with UC Berkeley, emphasizing to the audience the importance of academia’s engagement with industry, from research grants to workforce development to business incubation. Within the last year, UI has changed its approach to intellectual property and facilitated such interactions. We will continue to seek other ways, throughout the state, to engage with industry.<br>
<br>
Biotechnology is just one example of a potential growth industry for Idaho and the nation, a future UI is forging through education and research. Successful economic development requires a broad range of skills and degrees. Over the last two days in Boise we highlighted STEM education (though we also saw a great example of UI’s extraordinary business education). Preparing STEM graduates begins with engaging K-12 experiences and continues through doctoral degrees, and UI is involved in all phases of STEM education. Dynamic STEM learning experiences provided to K-12 students include our Engineering Design Expo, the McCall Outdoor Science School and many more. Once students come to UI, they find great STEM courses and the opportunity to work in research labs. UI’s Howard Hughes Medical Institute grant, led by Trish Hartzell, aims to enhance the engagement and interest of students in introductory science courses, a key PCAST recommendation. UI leads Idaho in producing STEM doctoral degrees, as well. But STEM graduates alone cannot fuel a business. At Wednesday’s breakfast, Mario Reyes, Dean of the College of Business and Economics, shared a great video of a recent “elevator pitch” competition that is part of entrepreneurship education, earning applause from the audience and from Dr. Penhoet.<br>
<br>
The Micron Foundation has joined UI to support a <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/academics/stem/signature-area/micron"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">STEM Educational Research Initiative</a>, exploring the complex factors that spur interest and learning in the fields. We must use that knowledge to find innovative ways to increase STEM performance and competitiveness and to increase enrollment at UI. Micron’s STEM conference included speakers, presentations and the participation of Dr. Penhoet. That work dovetailed with Wednesday’s State Board of Education STEM summit, which brought together stakeholders from education and industry to discuss how we can move STEM forward in our K-12 system.<br>
<br>
UI also shapes the future by leading the state in research, doubling the research expenditures of all other universities combined. We also head several statewide research initiatives, including the <a href=""http://inbre.uidaho.edu/"" style=""color:#b18e5f;"" target=""_blank"">IDeA Network of Biomedical Research Excellence</a>, or INBRE, and two COBRE projects from the National Institutes of Health, all very relevant to the biotechnology industry.<br>
<br>
With support from the state and our K-12 and higher education partners, UI is a leader in STEM education and research for our state. Idaho’s future demands our excellence in these areas, and consultation with thought leaders like Dr. Penhoet helps UI rise to the challenge of leading Idaho forward.</span>

2015-08-21,An American Dream Institution,"August 21, 2015 	<br> <img src=""../images/friday_letter_head_2014.jpg"" > <br>Dear Friends,<br><br>Today young men and women from all over the world begin their educational journeys as Vandals. At Convocation this morning, our faculty and staff members gather to welcome our incoming freshmen and transfer students. We applaud them for making a momentous decision: By attending UI, they’ve taken a crucial step in achieving their American Dream.<br><br>The American Dream is a national ethos of the United States, in which freedom includes the opportunity for prosperity and success, and upward social mobility for children and families – achieved through hard work in a society with few barriers. Over and over again, in the lives of countless students and their families, that dream matures at the University of Idaho. Together with our faculty and staff, I am inspired to work at UI because we help build the future and continue the American Dream <a href=""http://www.socialmobilityindex.org/ "" >(link)</a> . Our incoming students will unlock their potential, discover new interests and absorb different perspectives – building blocks for a personally satisfying and financially stable life.<br><br>UI, like other leading, national research universities, provides those building blocks in a very special way. Universities like ours provide real-world research and scholarly experience for students as well as instruction by faculty on the leading edge of their disciplines. The young men and women in the Convocation crowd this morning will have a chance to work directly alongside professors who are recognized experts in their fields. Maybe they’ll help rediscover a piece of Idaho’s heritage <a href=""http://www.ktvb.com/news/local/archaeological-dig-underway-in-boise/175767730"" >(link)</a>  on an archaeology project. Maybe they’ll unlock the key to understanding the next Ebola epidemic <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/sci/news/features/2015/ebola-working-group"" >(link)</a> . They will all grow as individuals, become experts in their fields, and acquire transferable skills to innovate throughout their lives.<br><br>Students pursue those transformative experiences as part of a diverse cohort of students from around the world. At Convocation this morning, students sit beside colleagues from every state in the nation, and from more than 70 countries around the world. Students from big cities study with students from small towns and family farms. A student from Brazil or Saudi Arabia can exchange ideas and forge lifelong friendships with a student from Boise, or Idaho Falls, or Seattle. Students emerge from UI prepared not just with career skills, but with the global understandings they need to compete and collaborate in the 21st century.<br><br>We’ll share these ideas with our students this morning. We’ll also share what they can look forward to after graduation, the success with which so many of our alumni, friends and supporters are already familiar. You read the stories, you hear it from your friends, and you experience it in your own life – Vandal alumni do great things. Whether it’s exploring the final frontier <a href=""https://www.kcet.org/history-society/tom-mueller-from-idaho-logger-to-space-explorer"" >(link)</a>  of space, reaching lofty heights in public service <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/about/my-university/linda-copple-trout"" >(link)</a>  or creating a stronger future for agriculture  , Vandals make the world better.<br><br>As we begin this exciting new year, I encourage our alumni to be involved at UI. Join an advisory board, or engage with the alumni association <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/alumni?utm_source=82115&utm_medium=email&utm_content=alumni-landing_page&utm_campaign=friday-letter15"" >(link)</a> . Reach out to a college or department – or our Career Center <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/career-services"" >(link)</a>  – and see how your company or organization can engage students at UI. Talk to young people still making decisions for their future about what your college experience meant to you. Our Vandal family is so important to the success of our university. It’s one key place where we distinguish ourselves from other universities. As Paul Joyce, Dean of Science, puts it, UI is “big enough to matter, and small enough to care.” That care shines through brightly in the passion and commitment of our alumni.<br><br>We have big challenges ahead of us. I’m eager to watch this class of freshmen embrace the opportunities inherent in those challenges, and I look forward to seeing them achieve their American Dream through a Vandal education. <br><br><br> <img src=""../images/b86fa38b-7c6c-414d-a792-806540da37ba.jpg"" > <br><br>	<br>Go Vandals!<br><br>Chuck Staben<br>President <br> <img src=""../images/down_darkbg.jpg"" > <br>Here's the Latest News from the University of Idaho	 <br><br>Scholarship Supports International Engineering Opportunities	 <br>The College of Engineering is grateful to Daniella and Andy Emerson ’97 for providing perpetual support of students through the newly created Emerson International Engineering Scholarship Endowment. Inspired by his own study abroad experience as a student, Andy wanted to provide international leadership opportunities that will prepare students to compete globally and inspire a passion necessary to take on 21st-century challenges. “Our alumni, faculty and corporate partners understand that engineering graduates with international experiences are in demand,” said Dean Stauffer. “For our graduates to become engineering leaders in their fields, it will require a deep understanding and appreciation for how different societies and industries operate around the world.” Andy is the president of MH Solutions, a provider of engineered material handling systems for mining and heavy industry, and serves on the UI Foundation board of directors. For more information on giving to the College of Engineering <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/inspire/ways/academics/engineering"" >(link)</a> , contact Mary Lee Ryba at (208) 755-4916 or mryba@uidaho.edu <mailto:mryba@uidaho.edu?subject=Giving%20to%20the%20College%20of%20Engineering"" >(link)</a> .	 <br>SEL Gives $2 Million to Establish Endowed Chair	 <br>Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories, Inc. (SEL) has donated $2 million to the University of Idaho College of Engineering to create an endowed chair position   in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. “The Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories Chair in Power Engineering” establishes a highly honored academic position that will attract and support distinguished faculty in the field of power engineering and further the college’s mission of excellence in fundamental engineering education with real-world applications. SEL invents, designs and builds digital products and systems that protect power grids around the world. This technology prevents blackouts and enables customers to improve power system reliability, safety and cost. An endowed chair is a distinguished university professorship that is used to attract a preeminent scholar in a specific academic field, in this case power engineering. The enhanced financial support and prestige generated by the endowment will dramatically fuel future innovation in electric power research and teaching.	 <br>UI Leads National Project to Combat Potato Nematodes	 <br>The University of Idaho will lead a $3.2 million project to combat microscopic worms   that threaten potato production. The project, which focuses on the pale cyst nematode and golden nematode, relies on university, federal and industry efforts. These nematodes can reduce potato production by up to 80 percent by infecting the plant’s roots, draining energy that would otherwise create tubers. One of the nematode’s worst qualities for farmers is that its cysts or egg clusters can survive up to 30 years in the soil. The $3.2 million grant from the USDA Food Security Challenge Area program is one of only three projects funded nationally this year. The project's research and extension team of eighteen scientists includes six UI faculty members in the areas of nematology, plant pathology, plant molecular biology, Extension, and agricultural economics.	 <br>	<br>	<br>Office of the President | 875 Perimeter Drive MS 3151 | Moscow ID 83844-3151 	<br><br>          <br>University of Idaho · 875 Perimeter Drive · Moscow, ID 83844 · USA <br><br>	<br> "
2015-08-28,Foundations for a Safe Campus,"August 28, 2015 	<br> <img src=""../images/78d0092c-6b67-41ab-8113-fb516677185b.jpg"" > 	<br>	<br>Dear Friends, 	<br>As a father of three college-age children, I’ve had to drop my students off at college three times. That’s a tough experience for any parent — leaving your loved one in a new place, on their own with new people and new experiences. At the University of Idaho, we’re trusted to provide a safe, positive educational experience for students. As I told parents and guardians at Convocation last week, that’s a commitment we take seriously, and we strive to maintain a campus environment that offers each student the chance to learn and grow as individuals and as members of a caring community.<br> <br>UI has been and continues to be a safe campus for all the members of our community. A safe campus environment starts with clear expectations about how students treat one another and what resources and support are available. For the third consecutive year, incoming full-time undergraduates at UI are required to take a “Think About It” <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/orientation/think-about-it"" >(link)</a>  course. This interactive program poses realistic scenarios and offers opportunities for guided self-reflection. Focusing on sexual assault, alcohol and drug use, and healthy relationships, this program has accomplished very high completion rates. Now in its third consecutive year of implementation at UI, the program has been updated to include understandings of survivor trauma and keep up with compliance measures in federal regulations.<br> <br>Promotion of campus safety takes center stage soon during the fourth annual Campus Safety Week <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/events/safety-week"" >(link)</a> , September 14-19. A number of partners across campus, including student groups and leaders, will come together for events that promote a safe campus. The “I Got Your Back” campaign highlights Vandals taking care of Vandals. The “Green Dot” program highlights the importance of bystander intervention. This year I’ll proudly attend the “Take Back the Night” rally that raises awareness about sexual assault and violence prevention. Teaching skills, highlighting resources and promoting attitudes, these programs can stay with our students all year.<br> <br>It’s also important that we have the infrastructure that promotes a safe campus. Throughout the fall and spring we’ll be installing additional security cameras in our common areas and in access points to key buildings. This is a project we’ve made a special effort to fund, and we’re phasing it in over time as feasible. The additional cameras bolster an already strong network, affording UI security and law enforcement personnel the opportunity to better monitor activity and take action when needed.<br> <br>From individual behavior, to group consciousness, to physical tools and resources, there are many facets to campus safety. Our evolving university programs and practices are a strong foundation for a safe campus. We can all be glad that we have dedicated students, faculty and staff who know that we are a stronger community when we look out for each other as a Vandal family. Driving away from campus after dropping off a student is tough enough — parents and families leave UI knowing that their student is in a place that supports them on their educational journey. 	<br> <img src=""../images/a92b8e7b-feb6-4699-b611-bf0d66b204cc.jpg"" > 	<br>Go Vandals!<br><br>Chuck Staben<br>President 	<br>	<br> <img src=""../images/d329a9c8-6907-4172-8ec6-c529ed12ce69.jpg"" > 	<br><br>Here's the Latest News from the University of Idaho<br><br>	<br><br>Local Vandals Leaving Their Mark on Idaho Athletics<br><br><br>Melissa ’04 and Dustin Weitz of Moscow have been loyal supporters of the Vandal Scholarship Fund <a href=""http://www.govandals.com"" >(link)</a>  for years.

To help Northwest communities prepare for the future, University of Idaho and Washington State University researchers are studying ways to increase communities’ ability to withstand and recover from wildfires with the support of a new $2.8 million grant   from the National Science Foundation. An interdisciplinary research team will focus on improving models that predict where fires are likely to occur, how severe they will be and whether they are likely to produce post-fire floods and landslides. The team will then create a virtual early warning system to help identify particularly vulnerable communities and ecosystems in the region. The researchers will work closely with an advisory team of academic, government and industry stakeholders to help translate the research results into action plans for communities at risk.<br><br><br>UI Highly Ranked in Washington Monthly<br><br><br>The University of Idaho ranks No. 61 in the nation <a href=""http://washingtonmonthly.com/college_guide/rankings-2015/national-universities-rank.php"" >(link)</a>  among national universities, according to Washington Monthly’s 2015 rankings released Monday.

2015-09-04,How We Power the Future,"September 4, 2015 	<br> <img src=""../images/78d0092c-6b67-41ab-8113-fb516677185b.jpg"" > 	<br>	<br>Dear Friends, 	<br>This week, we announced the chair of the Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories Endowed Chair in Power Engineering  . Brian K. Johnson, a professor in the College of Engineering’s electrical and computer engineering department, brings national recognition in the field, a track record of securing and completing exciting research, and a deep commitment to the success of students. This is a great choice for SEL’s first-ever endowed chair   at a university, and we’re very grateful to have their vote of confidence in our excellence.<br><br>SEL has been a valued partner of UI for many years. A global leader in power technology, SEL employs more than 250 UI alumni out of 4,000 employees worldwide. They also offer internship opportunities, assist with student projects and research, sponsor College of Engineering programs, and participate in our annual Engineering Design Expo.<br><br>A $2 million gift from SEL makes this endowed chair possible. That generosity translates to income of about $90,000 per year, in perpetuity. Those funds provide partial salary support for the designated chair, as well as flexible funds to enhance graduate and undergraduate research, equipment, or other needs to move Professor Johnson’s work forward. SEL is a world-class company, and as we strive to be a world-class university, we’re glad to have a partner on the Palouse helping us achieve lofty goals.<br><br>UI engages with industry at many levels, relationships from which industries and our university both benefit. When we partner with industry, whether it’s through a new faculty or chair position, or through sponsored research, faculty and students find opportunities to work in real-world settings, identifying major problems. Similarly, internships lead to the acquisition of skills and often to great jobs. We sustain industry with a talent pipeline of graduates well-prepared to contribute to leading-edge organizations. Our research expertise allows us to address issues that affect industry and keep them strong for our state and our region.<br><br>During my presidency, we’ve remapped the way we engage with industry, especially in respect to our intellectual property (IP) agreements. It’s now easier for companies to benefit from intellectual property created during research projects they support. UI retains the right to publish research — a critical part of our university mission. Those changes first bore fruit with a research agreement with SEL, and UI has gone on to forge agreements with Idaho Power Company, with Avista Corporation and, now, just this August, with Micron Technology Inc.<br><br>These enhancements are new and robust, positioning us well for the future. They follow a historic pattern of UI engagement with industry. For more than 100 years we’ve worked with industries important to Idaho, including in fields like agriculture and natural resources, where research has contributed to new potato and wheat varieties, better agricultural and forestry practices, and improved training and know-how for industry and communities.<br><br>This week Dr. Schweitzer said something that sticks with me. As a freshman at Purdue, his Engineering 101 professor asked, “Why do you want to be an engineer?” He said becoming an engineer meant he could “take science, math and technology, and put them to work to improve the world.” He certainly has done that at SEL. It’s also what we do at UI across fields of research and scholarly activity — put concepts into action. We Vandals work on ideas that matter — a framework that you’ll be hearing more about in the future as we lay out a vision for UI in our strategic planning. 	<br> <img src=""../images/a92b8e7b-feb6-4699-b611-bf0d66b204cc.jpg"" > 	<br>Go Vandals!<br><br>Chuck Staben<br>President 	<br>	<br> <img src=""../images/d329a9c8-6907-4172-8ec6-c529ed12ce69.jpg"" > 	<br><br>Here's the Latest News from the University of Idaho<br><br>	<br><br>A Witness to Changes Supports Futures of 4-H Students<br><br><br>Mary Jean Craig worked as an extension educator for the University of Idaho Extension 4-H Youth Development for 30 years.

2015-09-11,Great Examples of Vandal Energy,"September 11, 2015 	<br> <img src=""../images/78d0092c-6b67-41ab-8113-fb516677185b.jpg"" > 	<br>	<br>Dear Friends, 	<br>Maybe you’ve experienced something like this in your own lives, whether you work at a company, go to school or are involved in community organizations. Invariably, there are people making things happen behind the scenes. The lights stay on, the facilities stay clean, the services continue on as expected — the work gets done.<br><br>That holds true at the University of Idaho. The work gets done - a routine excellence that can sometimes go unnoticed. One thing I and others have definitely noticed over the past year, however, is the work of our Steam Plant crew. They keep the lights on, of course, but they also have fun while doing it. About a year ago I first saw a pair of skeletons <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10153329422710996.1073741884.8990210995&type=3"" >(link)</a>  in the street-level window on 6th Street. I’m sure I had the reaction many others have had — surprise, a chuckle, and another look at the building and reflection about its role at UI.<br><br>Since then, the Steam Plant crew has regularly arranged and rearranged the skeletons to play off the mood or goings-on at UI or in the broader world. For instance, in late spring the skeletons had books in hand, studying for finals. They broke out a beach ball to welcome summer, then grabbed American flags and joined us in celebrating the Fourth of July. They even hopped on a bicycle to get in some exercise at one point.<br><br>Part of the skeletons’ job is to draw some attention to the Steam Plant, and I think they have succeeded in that. The plant is a facility of which we can be very proud <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/infrastructure/facilities/ues/energy/biomass"" >(link)</a> . Many university energy plants run on fossil fuels — but not ours. Our plant runs on biomass, cedar wood chip, for 90 percent of its fuel. That waste is a renewable resource <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/infrastructure/facilities/ues/energy/steam-production"" >(link)</a>  that doesn’t add carbon to the environment, unlike fossil fuels. And the sourcing of the fuel from nearby sawmills means UI supports local industries that keep Idahoans at work and our economy strong.<br><br>The skeletons also succeed in lifting our spirits. Whether you’re a student walking past and thinking about your next class, or an employee reflecting on some of the stress of the job, the skeletons provide a chance to smile, to enjoy a break from your routine, and be connected with others to the spirit of the university. That creative, quirky Vandal spirit shows up in a lot of ways, from our Vandal Marching Band to our Homecoming festivities every year. I appreciate how this particular staff crew connects and contributes to that feeling.<br><br>It’s a lesson in fun and imagination that we can all take to heart because let’s face it, higher education can be stressful. Now, not everyone needs to start putting skeletons in their windows. But congratulations to the Steam Plant crew for their ingenuity and generosity of spirit. They represent the many Vandals who make our university a great place <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/staffaffairs/vandal-appreciation-fair"" >(link)</a>  to work, live and learn. My hats off to them, and to the Vandal faculty and staff who contribute immeasurably to our university all year round. 	<br> <img src=""../images/a92b8e7b-feb6-4699-b611-bf0d66b204cc.jpg"" > 	<br>Go Vandals!<br><br>Chuck Staben<br>President 	<br>Steam Plant Skeletons Photo Gallery 	<br> <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10153329422710996.1073741884.8990210995&type=3"" >(link)</a> 	<br>	<br> <img src=""../images/d329a9c8-6907-4172-8ec6-c529ed12ce69.jpg"" > 	<br><br>Here's the Latest News from the University of Idaho<br><br>	<br><br>Mark and Laurie Engberg Transforming Art and Architecture<br><br><br>In August, Mark and Laurie Engberg made a transformational gift to the College of Art and Architecture.

In the former Ada County Courthouse, a stone’s throw from the Capitol, the center is a unique venue for legal education and civic engagement, and hosts the Idaho State Law Library. I’m looking forward to the impact this center will have for students, for faculty members and for legal education in our state. The ILJLC is the culmination of Don Burnett’s vision; I thank our former president and dean of the law school on behalf of our state and our university.<br><br>The new center offers an opportunity to further extend UI’s superb legal education to our state’s largest urban center. UI expanded to include a second year of programs in Boise, and we plan to add a first-year component <a href=""http://www.nationaljurist.com/prelaw/uidaho-opens-boise-building-plans-first-years-2017"" >(link)</a>  to that program in 2017, pending approval from the State Board of Education and the American Bar Association. This dual-location approach presents a flexible way for students to take advantage of a UI legal education that is clearly in demand. Many law schools nationwide are experiencing enrollment declines, but UI Law has successfully navigated   a challenging environment while maintaining quality and increasing resident students and diversity.<br><br>The careers and good works of Vandal graduates prove UI Law’s excellence every day. For many years our law school graduates have been leaders in bench and bar in the courtrooms of Idaho. Currently four of the five justices on the Idaho Supreme Court, and three out of the four justices on the Idaho Court of Appeals call UI their alma mater. A UI grad, Linda Copple Trout, was the first female justice named to the Idaho Supreme Court — one of many groundbreaking Vandal graduates who have emerged from our law school.<br><br>Not all graduates serve in the legal profession, of course. Vandals from the College of Law include leaders such as Frank Shrontz, the former CEO of Boeing; Mas Kawana, a 2006 J.D. recipient from UI, the executive director and head of tax operations for JPMorgan Chase in New York; and Nancy Morris, the former secretary of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. From business, to marketing, to government and beyond, it’s clear that a legal education from UI is great preparation for success in many careers.<br><br>While our law school continues to have a valued home in Moscow, we are excited to have future generations of leaders in many professions take classes in the heart of Boise. Dean Mark Adams recently said it well: “The hard work of many people is paying off in the opening of this center. It’s a great symbol for the exciting things that are happening at the College of Law. The future is filled with possibilities we’re ready to embrace.”<br><br>I share that optimism, and look forward to the Idaho Law and Justice Learning Center becoming a landmark of excellence of which all Idahoans can be proud. 	<br> <img src=""../images/a92b8e7b-feb6-4699-b611-bf0d66b204cc.jpg"" > 	<br>Go Vandals!<br><br>Chuck Staben<br>President 	<br>	<br> <img src=""../images/d329a9c8-6907-4172-8ec6-c529ed12ce69.jpg"" > 	<br><br>HERE'S THE LATEST NEWS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO<br><br>	<br><br>Laura Moore Cunningham Foundation Supports UI<br><br>A gift of $535,000 from the Laura Moore Cunningham Foundation to the University of Idaho will help fund student scholarships as well as furnishings for the newly renovated College of Education <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/inspire/ways/academics/college-of-education"" >(link)</a> .

href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/cals/celebrating-ag?utm_source=91715&utm_medium=email&utm_content=cals-celebrate_ag&utm_campaign=friday-letter15"" target=""_blank""><span style='color:#B18E5F'>Celebrating Idaho Agriculture</span></a> and <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/alumni/sarb/dadsweekend"" target=""_blank""><span style='color:#B18E5F'>Dad’s Weekend</span></a>. Our state has been shaped by agriculture, from the wheat fields of the Palouse, to the potato, dairy and livestock industries in southern Idaho. The University of Idaho seeds innovation and education in this more than $25 billion industry that accounts for one in every seven jobs in the state. In classrooms, in fields and in Extension facilities statewide, agriculture is a field in which UI cultivates ideas that matter.<br>&nbsp;<br>Food systems are critical in our hungry world, and the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences contributes expertise and insight to meeting important challenges. In the nation’s No. 1 potato-producing state, the CALS potato team plays a key role in the development of new varieties, pest and disease management, storage and breeding. UI is the leader on a <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/cals/news/feature/pcn-grant"" target=""_blank""><span style='color:#B18E5F'>$3.2 million USDA-funded project</span></a> to combat microscopic worms that threaten potato production. Similarly, UI is a leader in Idaho’s critical beef industry, with a talented and <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/extension/news/story/beef-specialist-john-b-hall-honored-for-extension-efforts"" target=""_blank""><span style='color:#B18E5F'>nationally recognized team</span></a> of faculty members, researchers and Extension staff. I’m excited about extending our research impact into the established arena of dairy production. UI clearly has resources and expertise that can address issues and challenges within this fast-growing Idaho industry.<br>&nbsp;<br>Our success as a leader in Idaho agriculture rests in great measure on our ability to effectively partner with industry. Our partnership with LimaGrain Cereal Seeds, for instance, means expedited commercialization of wheat varieties. Support from the Idaho Barley Commission and the Idaho Wheat Commission further propel research in issues critical to those industries. The J.R. Simplot Company is another important partnership that helps facilitate agricultural excellence.<br>&nbsp;<br>UI continues to train generations of industry leaders. The list of Vandal alumni in agriculture reads like a “who’s who” of industry leaders. Phil Soulen, president of a family-owned livestock company and past president of the Idaho Wool Growers Association, is a UI alumnus and a member of our Alumni Hall of Fame. Annette Elg is senior vice president and chief financial officer for the J.R. Simplot Company. Joe Anderson, the Idaho Wheat Commission chairman, is a CALS graduate and highly involved alumnus. Lieutenant Governor Brad Little is a CALS grad with a family history steeped in the sheep industry. Our state’s governor, Butch Otter, can point to his time in 4-H as a formative experience. And in companies like Simplot, Agribeef and Glanbia, our graduates become valued employees, building careers that make an impact in Idaho and beyond.<br>&nbsp;<br>We have a fun weekend planned, with activities and educational opportunities for community members of all ages, as well as prospective students — all great traditions. Hopefully Vandal Dads can take part with their sons and daughters, as well, building on that great Vandal tradition of family and agriculture. I encourage folks to come out, support the Vandals, learn about agriculture and maybe even take a picture with the Idaho Potato Commission’s “Big Idaho Potato.” Vandal excellence helps grow that potato, after all, and crops, cattle, sheep and more just as big and plentiful. <o:p></o:p></span></p></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><p class=MsoNormal><span

2015-10-02,Engaging with Our Tribal Partners,"October 2, 2015 	<br> <img src=""../images/78d0092c-6b67-41ab-8113-fb516677185b.jpg"" > 	<br>	<br>Dear Friends, 	<br>This week at the University of Idaho, our College of Natural Resources <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/cnr?utm_source=100215&utm_medium=email&utm_content=college_natural_resources-home_page&utm_campaign=friday-letter15"" >(link)</a> , Office of Tribal Relations <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/president/direct-reports/tribal-relations"" >(link)</a>  and tribal partners from across the region came together in an important summit at UI. The 2015 Tribal Natural Resource Education Summit brought together UI faculty members and administrators and tribal leaders and professionals. The summit is one example of how UI can collaborate with Native American communities to meet needs and embrace opportunities.<br><br>The summit grew out of discussions our university has had within the President’s Native American Advisory Council. Last spring as a council we worked to identify opportunities to leverage UI resources and expertise with the experience and insight of tribal leadership and professionals. Natural resources are an important part of tribal economies, culture and traditional knowledge, so as a group we realized that the College of Natural Resources had a role to play in partnership. The summit focuses on developing educational capacity within the college to enhance tribal workforce development.<br><br>The day-and-a-half summit features speakers, presenters and panelists from UI and from the tribal nations that have a memorandum of understanding <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/president/direct-reports/tribal-relations/mou"" >(link)</a>  (MOU) with the university. That MOU is a guiding document that bespeaks a commitment to strengthening the relationship between the university and signatory tribes. (In Spring 2015 the Yakama Nation joined as the 10th MOU member.) I’m pleased that that this summit represents concrete action that aligns with that goal, and I look forward to more discussion with the MOU tribes in November at our next advisory council meeting.<br><br>Next summer the university’s engagement with tribes will reach across an even broader spectrum of Native American communities. The University of Idaho will host the first-ever National Tribal Climate Boot Camp  , with members of tribes from across the United States convening at our McCall Field Campus. Tribal leaders will work with faculty from UI and other research universities on programs and training for the week-long educational experience. It’s another opportunity to examine needs and opportunities, learn from traditional knowledge and perspectives, and find ways to partner in addressing the challenges posed by climate-related impacts.<br><br>Many people at UI work very hard to create an environment for collaboration with our Native American partners. It’s an area where we’ve exercised leadership and have taken steps to better sustain the resources found at our state’s leading, national research university. It’s also undoubtedly an area where we can do more. I’m grateful to have MOU tribes engaged with us on improvement, and I know that all of us will benefit from that hard work in the future. 	<br> <img src=""../images/a92b8e7b-feb6-4699-b611-bf0d66b204cc.jpg"" > 	<br>Go Vandals!<br><br>Chuck Staben<br>President 	<br>	<br> <img src=""../images/d329a9c8-6907-4172-8ec6-c529ed12ce69.jpg"" > 	<br><br>THE LATEST NEWS FROM UI<br><br>	<br><br>Dotys Honor Legacies with CLASS Support<br><br>College of Letters, Arts and Social Sciences (CLASS) alumni Ben ’53 and Pat Doty ’54 cherished their experience at the University of Idaho. It's not only where they met, but it is also where they received the education that gave them a jumpstart in life. Their life together has taken them to amazing places and amazing heights. Ben served as a major general in the army while Pat took command in successfully raising their children. Their Vandal experience meant so much to them that Ben recently created a new endowment in journalism and political science that will provide two scholarships and a faculty award. ""We are honored that Ben has chosen to honor the Doty family legacy with these two scholarships and a faculty award in CLASS,” said CLASS Dean Andrew Kersten. “His gift will have a significant and lasting impact for years to come.” For more information on supporting the programs in CLASS, contact Peter Mundt at (208) 885-5013 or peterm@uidaho.edu <mailto:peterm@uidaho.edu"" >(link)</a> . <br><br>Dean Baird Honored as Librarian of the Year<br><br>Lynn Baird worked her first library job as an undergraduate student at University of Pacific, putting labels on the spines of books. It was there and by attending a conference with the university's librarians that she became inspired to begin a career in library sciences - a path that has led her to being selected as this year's Librarian of the Year   by the Idaho Library Association. Baird, along with some of her librarians, will attend the awards ceremony and banquet Thursday at Boise State University. Baird said all of the work she's done throughout the years, including with international organizations, has been to help advance libraries in a way that everyone has access and an opportunity to gain knowledge. <br><br>Sage Grouse Listing Validates Collaborative Approaches<br><br>The decision on Tuesday, Sept. 22, by the Department of Interior to not list sage grouse under the Endangered Species Act validates the hard work and collaboration   of many agencies, landowners and the University of Idaho. “Conserving sage grouse is a complex challenge that requires the collective efforts of land managers, scientists and all those who enjoy the vast sagebrush ecosystems. This announcement is a tribute to the hard work and dedication of many people,” said Karen Launchbaugh, professor in the College of Natural Resources and director of the UI Rangeland Center. The Rangeland Center has been a leader in helping ranchers better understand the relationships between grazing and sage grouse habitat. “I am encouraged that research, education and management can join together in efforts to sustain the ecological and economic values that we hold dear in the west,” Launchbaugh said. <br>	<br>Office of the President | 875 Perimeter Drive MS 3151 | Moscow ID 83844-3151<br><br>Copyright © 2015 University of Idaho, All rights reserved.<br>You are receiving this email because of your affiliation with the University of Idaho.<br><br><br>         <br><br>	<br> "

I wanted to give everyone an update on some of our successes from the past year and current work upon which we’re engaged. Importantly, I also wanted to express my belief in our shared purpose as Idaho’s leading institution of higher education, and describe a vision for the University of Idaho’s next 10 years.<br><br>Across the state of Idaho, we are changing lives through access to an affordable, high-quality education at a research university. We can and will make that “transformative education” possible for more students. Too many qualified students, especially students from Idaho, don’t go on to postsecondary education. That represents lost opportunities for individual students, as well as for our state. With focus and innovation, over the next 10 years, we can reshape Idaho’s higher education landscape and strengthen our university. We have exciting initiatives that will bring the value of higher education to our state’s high school students, educating them about their options and communicating next steps <a href=""https://nextsteps.idaho.gov/"" >(link)</a>  toward their pursuit of the American Dream.<br><br>Another area where our university excels, and where we can move forward with renewed focus, is in research, scholarly activity and creative work. At UI, that discovery and innovation is the pursuit of “ideas that matter <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/research/about-research/2015-research-report"" >(link)</a> .” The caliber, scope and amount of research we do at UI sets us apart — double the combined total of other state institutions. We can be proud of the research that shapes our world for the better in everything from complex systems modeling, to wildfire research, to cybersecurity. Going forward, interdisciplinary research <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/research/iric"" >(link)</a>  will be the key to breaking new ground and accelerating the impact that UI has for our state and our world.<br><br>Lastly, I explored the urgency of “building our team.” We need to continue to make sure the university is a great place not just to work but to build a career, and that it is a purpose-driven organization, a vibrant intellectual community that attracts, retains, and develops great faculty and staff. It’s no secret that employee compensation that has lagged behind some of our peer institutions and regional competitors. To continue to attract and retain the workforce that makes our university be the best it can be, we need to meet goals for growth that allow us to invest in our people. You can’t buy loyalty, but you can lose loyalty. For our students and our state, we cannot let that happen.<br><br>Recently in my office, we found an old document — a plan by President Donald Theophilus, penned in 1959, and outlining a vision for the next 10 years, through 1970. Those themes and goals from more than 50 years ago still resonate today. That tells me that at UI, we know who we are. We know who we serve. And we know that we need to continue to work together to build a stronger UI … driven by purpose, motivated by excellence, and passionate about the future and all it will bring. 	<br> <img src=""../images/a92b8e7b-feb6-4699-b611-bf0d66b204cc.jpg"" > 	<br>Go Vandals!<br><br>Chuck Staben<br>President 	<br>	<br> <img src=""../images/d329a9c8-6907-4172-8ec6-c529ed12ce69.jpg"" > 	<br><br>THE LATEST NEWS FROM UI<br><br>	<br><br>Grant Supports Main Street Legal Clinic<br><br>The Idaho Law Foundation recently awarded $15,000 to the University of Idaho’s College of Law for the Main Street Law Clinic <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/law/academics/practical-skills/clinics/main-street?utm_source=10915&utm_medium=email&utm_content=law-academics-skills-main_street&utm_campaign=friday-letter15"" >(link)</a>  to support community redevelopment legal assistance.

The film will be followed by brief remarks from Guzmán and a welcoming reception. The Moscow program will also include a film screening of “The Judge and the General,” at 3:30 p.m. PDT, Tuesday, Oct. 13, in the courtroom of the Menard Building, followed by a panel discussion. Guzmán’s lecture, “Truth, Justice and Democracy: Post Dictatorship,” will be at 3 p.m. Pacific time Wednesday, Oct. 14, in the Bruce M.

Oftentimes, such questions are posed in an interesting way: What are you doing about enrollment? How will you ensure access and affordability for more students? Now, that phrasing often just reflects a shorthand approach to a complicated topic, but the real question is how we will all work together to move the university and Idaho forward.<br><br>Of course, our staff and faculty are working very hard on many initiatives, including increasing enrollment. But the university has a not-so-secret weapon that I think we can engage more fully: the Vandal alumni base. This is a network — a family, we proudly say — of more than 100,000 people who have experienced firsthand the transformative impact of a Vandal education. What better ambassadors could there be for the University of Idaho?<br><br>With that in mind, I’m pleased to announce our new Vandals in Partnership (VIP) program <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/alumni/get-involved/vandals-in-partnership"" >(link)</a> . The Vandals in Partnership program taps into the enthusiasm and experience of alumni volunteers to make a difference for undergraduate student enrollment. It starts with our successful “Grow the Gold” <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/alumni/stay-connected/growthegold"" >(link)</a>  program, which asks alumni to nominate students for admission to UI, kicking off a relationship between a prospective student and UI. The new VIP program goes beyond “Grow the Gold,” giving alumni volunteers the chance to get involved in undergraduate student recruitment at whatever level of commitment makes sense for them.<br><br>Want to share your personal story with prospective students at recruitment events? Want to get involved with UI admissions and alumni representatives to discuss approaches to recruitment? Want to really get involved by participating in panels at events, meeting one-on-one with students, or attending college fairs and other events as a UI representative? We want to use your time and talents. Your first step is simply visiting the Vandals in Partnership <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/alumni/get-involved/vandals-in-partnership"" >(link)</a>  website for more background, and a quick sign-up. VIPs will receive a packet of information about being a volunteer recruiter, and we’ll work with you to provide all the material you need to represent your university.<br><br>Growing enrollment <a href=""http://m.cdapress.com/archive/article-33a190f8-baad-5d2b-953e-0de500602eb9.html?mode=jqm"" >(link)</a>  has been a goal of mine since I started as president at the University of Idaho. It is our mission as a university to serve the students of Idaho and beyond. Education unlocks doors for students, strengthens communities, and unleashes innovation and growth for industry in our state and our world. We’re going to keep spreading that message, and you’ll hear more from me on this topic in the weeks ahead. Our alumni already know very well with the value of an education from Idaho’s leading, national research university, and that’s why we’re enlisting that insight and passion.<br><br>What are we doing to shape the future of the University of Idaho, and change the college-going culture in Idaho? That’s a question that, through the VIP program, can be answered by the best ambassadors a university can have — the alumni and friends who are committed to sharing its good work. 	<br> <img src=""../images/a92b8e7b-feb6-4699-b611-bf0d66b204cc.jpg"" > 	<br>Go Vandals!<br><br>Chuck Staben<br>President 	<br>	<br> <img src=""../images/d329a9c8-6907-4172-8ec6-c529ed12ce69.jpg"" > 	<br><br>THE LATEST NEWS FROM UI <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news"" >(link)</a> <br><br>	<br><br>American Chemical Society Supports Future Teachers<br><br>The American Chemical Society recently made a $12,000 gift to the Department of Chemistry.

Srivastava’s research focuses on electrokinetic simulations and design of microfluidic systems for medical diagnostic applications along with educational research including enhancing student engagement and learning. She currently teaches courses in bioengineering, process analysis and controls, and engineering thermodynamics and heat transfer. “My approach to teaching involves active student engagement and enhancing learning through short activities to develop discussions on the practical applications of course content,” Srivastava said. “I ask students for regular feedback by incorporating it into biweekly class assignments.” Srivastava operates the Microfluidics and Electrokinetics bioSeparation and Analysis (MESA) Laboratory, which studies microfluidic transport phenomena and the design of fluidic devices with health care applications. Srivastava’s MESA lab supports the research and education of two graduate students and three undergraduate research assistants. One of the lab’s goals is to design commercially viable microdevices for clinical diagnostics. <br><br>Grant Provides Rehabilitation Counseling Scholarships<br><br>University of Idaho faculty members in the Rehabilitation Counseling and Human Services Program (RCHS), in the College of Education’s Department of Leadership and Counseling, have been awarded a five-year, $1 million Rehabilitation Training grant <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/100115-educationgrant"" >(link)</a>  from the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services-Rehabilitation Services Administration to provide academic training in vocational rehabilitation counseling and attract highly capable applicants.

On campus and across the state, we bundle up in Vandal gear, as the October days get chillier. In our arboretum, fall colors are on full display. Midterms have come and gone, to the relief and satisfaction of students and professors alike. Our Vandal football team, fresh off a hard-earned road victory, returns to the Kibbie Dome — just named one of the Top 10 football stadiums in the nation <a href=""http://fanindex.usatoday.com/2015/10/17/the-10-stadiums-with-the-best-atmosphere-in-college-football/"" >(link)</a>  by USA Today, by the way.

In keeping with this year’s theme and with long traditions, the week has been filled with festivities and service to others. Vandals participated in school spirit competitions and decorated downtown, UI offices and living spaces. Vandals have also been busy this week meeting needs in our local community. On Thursday, students collected food for local foodbanks, and supplies for a local violence and abuse prevention and support organization. They also organized and participated in UI’s annual blood drive, a time-honored tradition. Rafe Gibbs notes in “Beacon for Mountain and Plain,” a history of the University of Idaho, that campus blood drives started on behalf of wounded servicemen in the Korean War, and Vandal students “became nationally famous as blood-donating champions.”<br><br>I am glad that spirit of service <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/student-involvement/volunteer"" >(link)</a> , these small acts of heroism, continues with today’s students. Tonight we’ll rally around the bonfire after the serpentine to crown this year’s Homecoming Royalty. These events are fun, but they’re also a lot of work to organize, so we should give thanks to the many student leaders who take their time to help create lasting memories we can all share.<br><br>Tomorrow, the Homecoming parade will pour through downtown Moscow, one of the best college towns in America. We are proud to have the four ROTC units on campus <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/financial-aid/scholarships/more-scholarship-opportunities/rotcmilitaryscholarship"" >(link)</a>  — the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines — as our Grand Marshalls this year. Vandal ROTC members serve their university and their nation with commitment, courage and sacrifice. As we enjoy meeting friends at the tailgate or in the Fan Zone, and as we watch our Vandals compete on the gridiron, we can be grateful for our Grand Marshalls’ example of heroic service.<br><br>Many Vandals return to the Moscow campus during Homecoming. Our alumni set the example for current and future generations. Some have sons and daughters forging their own Vandal legacies. I look forward to renewing acquaintances and meeting new friends this week, saluting our heroes in the Armed Forces, and being reminded that there can be a hero in all of us. 	<br> <img src=""../images/ab869efb-0378-42c0-8506-5f9b6dd580f2.jpg"" > 	<br>Go Vandals!<br><br>Chuck Staben<br>President 	<br>	<br> <img src=""../images/d329a9c8-6907-4172-8ec6-c529ed12ce69.jpg"" > 	<br><br>THE LATEST NEWS FROM UI <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news"" >(link)</a> <br><br>	<br><br>Avista Gives Idaho Entrepreneurs a Boost<br><br>Avista Utilities has pledged $50,000 in matching support to the Idaho Entrepreneurs Gap Fund.

I’d just interviewed for the job of president of the University of Idaho, and was traveling to meet with the State Board of Education. Stopping in Grangeville for lunch at a diner, I struck up a conversation with our server, a high school senior. Asking him about his college plans, I learned that he didn’t have any. He’d not thought much about college. Neither had many of his friends.<br><br>Unfortunately, that’s an all-too-common story. As many as 5,000 qualified high school students in Idaho don’t “go on” to higher education every year. For these students, that’s a tragedy, and for our state, that is a missed opportunity. While a college degree is not for everyone, for many more students, it can be the path toward a better life with more financial stability, increased personal satisfaction, and stronger civic engagement. In short, a college degree is a road to attaining the American Dream.<br><br>Working with the State Board of Education and other stakeholders, UI is posed to make that road to the American Dream that much easier. The first step in getting to college, of course, is applying. That task is more complex than it may seem, something I discovered when testing out our application procedures. Now, there are many hurdles on the way to college, but students shouldn’t be tripping over the first one. We needed to make some changes.<br><br>As a state with the nation’s only united K-20 system, we’re in a position to make quick, straightforward changes to our processes. The State Board of Education has just mailed out a letter to qualified high school students, letting them know which Idaho institutions of public higher education they have been already been conditionally admitted to based on their track record of achievement in high school. We’re following up on that letter with proactive communications of our own, saying to many of those 5,000 students and their parents: You can succeed at the next level, you belong in college, and we want you to take that next step <a href=""https://nextsteps.idaho.gov/"" >(link)</a> .<br><br>We’re going even further, meeting the students where they live by hosting informational Enroll Idaho events at 43 locations across the state <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/admissions"" >(link)</a>  on Tuesday, Nov. 10. (To stay in the know with timely updates, join our Enroll Idaho event page <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/1626757900919042"" >(link)</a>  on Facebook.)

I’ll personally head back to Grangeville to meet with students there before going up to Coeur d’Alene for the Enroll Kootenai County event that night.<br><br>Following up on those steps, I’ve asked our James A. and Louise McClure Center for Public Policy Research to study the transition from high school to college. Their Idaho at a Glance report on the subject will come out in January, and will help us design policies and practices that promote postsecondary enrollment and attainment. We’ll also reach out again to students across Idaho with FAFSA-completion workshops and other recruitment events.<br><br>There is no single solution to increasing the go-on rates in Idaho. UI can and will be the leader in that effort, though. We will hold the door to the American Dream open for more Idaho students. For students in Coeur d’Alene, in Boise, in Grangeville and in communities large and small across Idaho, we must change the college-going culture to one that asks not “Should I go to college?” but “Where should I go to college?” It will take commitment by all stakeholders, on behalf of all of Idaho, but we can succeed. 	<br> <img src=""../images/ab869efb-0378-42c0-8506-5f9b6dd580f2.jpg"" > 	<br>Go Vandals!<br><br>Chuck Staben<br>President 	<br>	<br> <img src=""../images/d329a9c8-6907-4172-8ec6-c529ed12ce69.jpg"" > 	<br><br>THE LATEST NEWS FROM UI <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news"" >(link)</a> <br><br>	<br><br>CDC Grant Supports Study of Logging Safety<br><br>The UI Experimental Forest will be the test site for technological advancements to keep loggers safer.

You find a couple pennies, or nickels or quarters on the ground. They wind up at the bottom of your washing machine, or stuck in the seat of your car, or at the back of a drawer. Wherever they are, maybe they come in useful now and again, but they’re probably not serving a greater good. That’s okay. It’s just spare change, after all, right?<br><br>Not at UI, though. If you haven’t heard of the “Found Money Fund,” <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/giving/make-a-gift/annual-giving/found-money-fund?utm_source=110615&utm_medium=email&utm_content=giving-annual_giving-found_money_fund&utm_campaign=friday-letter15"" >(link)</a>  it’s one of the quirky, creative traditions that are such a part of our university. The idea started <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/alumni/foundmoneyfund/historyoffoundmoneyfund"" >(link)</a>  with Terry Armstrong, a longtime Vandal administrator and professor, and staff member Catherine Yenni Wilson. Both were Vandals through and through, dedicated to students and to the university. Walking by a fraternity house on campus one day in 1981, Terry found three pennies on the ground and put them in a jar. Others dropped loose change in the jar, as well. Soon, a campus tradition was born.<br><br>Needing a place to deposit all those nickels and dimes and stray bills, the Found Money Fund endowment was created. It has been added to through the years by contributions from alumni, faculty, staff and students the world over, who occasionally mail in loose change and bills — a small but appreciated gesture that complements a great spirit of donor generosity. Terry passed away last year, but the Found Money Fund is one way in which his legacy lives on. I actually first heard about the fund from a colleague with whom I worked at the University of South Dakota, and who wanted to start such a fund at that institution — proof that a good idea travels far.<br><br>Per Terry Armstrong’s wishes, the fund will mature in 2089. When it does, it will be used to enhance the university — its programs, its students, its faculty and staff — in ways that we might not imagine from our vantage point today. Now, 2089 offers a long horizon for adding to the fund and for watching interest accrue. With about $344,000 in the fund already, with steady contributions and a reasonable interest rate, we estimate that the fund will generate many millions of dollars after 73 years. That’s not such small change anymore, now is it?<br><br>Recently, we’ve relaunched the Found Money Fund. We actually have a fleet of little piggy banks that are hoping to find homes across campus. I encourage faculty, staff and students who are interested in supporting this project to learn more <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/giving/make-a-gift/annual-giving/found-money-fund?utm_source=110615&utm_medium=email&utm_content=giving-annual_giving-found_money_fund&utm_campaign=friday-letter15"" >(link)</a> , and maybe adopt a piggy bank of their own.<br><br>The Found Money Fund will mature long after many of us are gone. That’s part of the point, though. Little by little, with each nickel and each dime, we have a chance to express a belief in a better world for our students, for our children and for all those who come after us. So don’t feel silly about bending over to pick up those pennies. That spare change can and will add up to something special for the world to come. 	<br> <img src=""../images/ab869efb-0378-42c0-8506-5f9b6dd580f2.jpg"" > 	<br>Go Vandals!<br><br>Chuck Staben<br>President 	<br>P.S.: Speaking of traditions, I had started my own with a racquetball contest. Beat me in racquetball, and I’ll buy you lunch, I’ve been saying to undergraduates. I hadn’t had to spring for lunch since coming to UI – until this week. Cristobal Ramos Salazar, a key part of our men’s tennis team last year and an assistant with the team this year, beat me two games to none. The first game was close, the second, less so. My hat’s off to Cristobal for a great match. As a member of our Athletics staff mentioned, “Dr. Staben might consider training” if he wants to win. That’s probably a good lesson for all of us. Until then, I look forward to buying lunch for Cristobal and any other undergraduates who feel up to the challenge. 	<br>	<br> <img src=""../images/d329a9c8-6907-4172-8ec6-c529ed12ce69.jpg"" > 	<br><br>THE LATEST NEWS FROM UI <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news"" >(link)</a> <br><br>	<br><br>Alumni Give Back to College of Education<br><br>Debbie Maxwell Long ’72 and ’81 and Kathy Canfield-Davis ’87 believe in being brave and bold.

Besides giving their time and talent to UI, Long and Canfield-Davis jointly made a $25,000 gift to co-name a student space in the renovated Education building. “We have both held leadership positions in education for most of our careers,” Canfield-Davis said. “Deb and I are excited to give back and help create a comfortable, flexible environment that will encourage collaboration and active engagement among future Vandal leaders.” For information on supporting the College of Education <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/giving/ed?utm_source=110615&utm_medium=email&utm_content=giving-education&utm_campaign=friday-letter15"" >(link)</a> , contact Marta McClintock at (208) 885-7476 or martam@uidaho.edu <mailto:martam@uidaho.edu"" >(link)</a> . <br><br>College of Law Prominent among IBR Leaders in Law<br><br>The Idaho Business Review’s 2015 Leaders in Law list <a href=""http://blogs.uidaho.edu/law-accomplishments/college-of-law-announces-2015-idaho-business-review-leaders-in-law-awardees/?utm_source=110615&utm_medium=email&utm_content=blogs-law_accomplishments-2015_law_leaders&utm_campaign=friday-letter15"" >(link)</a>  includes eight University of Idaho College of Law graduates and a UI Law associate dean.

This is part of an annual event we call Leadership Weekend at the University of Idaho, a chance to keep our closest alumni and friends in the loop about UI life and activities, benefit from their wisdom and experience, and, in the midst of a busy semester, get a dose of refreshment and renewed energy from this group.<br><br>We have many advisory boards at UI, representing each of our colleges and our University Foundation. Each of those boards is entirely comprised of volunteers. These are alumni and others who are passionate about the excellence of each college, and who in many cases had transformative educational experiences here at UI. They are giving back their time and talent to making sure our programs are robust and forward-thinking for future generations of Vandals. You might not always see their names and faces out in front, but these women and men are championing the UI experience every day, and striving to make our university all that it can be.<br><br>At the board gathering this morning, I’ll offer a look into the state of the university, and try to answer questions about how UI is performing and where it is headed. We’re in the process of developing our new strategic plan <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/provost/strategic-plan?utm_source=111315&utm_medium=email&utm_content=provost-strategic_plan&utm_campaign=friday-letter15"" >(link)</a> , an effort led by Provost and Executive Vice President John Wiencek, so it’s an opportune time to hear the insight of alumni and friends close to UI. We are committed to building a stronger university over the next 10 years, and a solid plan is central to achieving that goal.<br><br>On the subject of committed Vandals, Friday night marks our annual Recognition Gala in Moscow. This is another occasion to reconnect with supporters of the University of Idaho – the donors who help make transformative educations possible for students, and who make a commitment to ideas that matter in innovation and discovery. No university in this day and age can succeed without a dedicated network of private support. This year, even with the end of our Inspiring Futures: Invest in the University of Idaho campaign, we have realized a record fundraising total. That support, in the immediate future and in the long-term, will make a profound difference in the lives of students and for the exciting work that addresses issues and challenges in our lives.<br><br>Thanks to all alumni and friends to the university. For those students reading the Friday Letter, we hope you see in the leaders on campus this weekend a role model for success, for integrity and dedication, and for lifelong commitment to the Vandal family. 	<br> <img src=""../images/ab869efb-0378-42c0-8506-5f9b6dd580f2.jpg"" > 	<br>Go Vandals!<br><br>Chuck Staben<br>President 	<br>	<br> <img src=""../images/d329a9c8-6907-4172-8ec6-c529ed12ce69.jpg"" > 	<br><br>THE LATEST NEWS FROM UI <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news"" >(link)</a> <br><br>	<br><br>University Gala Recognizes 1889 Society<br><br>University of Idaho donors will gather tonight for the annual University Gala where several new members of the prestigious 1889 Society, recognizing alumni, friends and partners whose cumulative contributions total $1 million and more, will be inducted.

2015-11-20,The Way Forward for a Great Life,"November 20, 2015 	<br> <img src=""../images/78d0092c-6b67-41ab-8113-fb516677185b.jpg"" > 	<br>Dear Friends, 	<br>Last week was a remarkable week for education in Idaho – for our K-12 schools, and for our higher education system. High school seniors across the state, and their parents, received letters of acceptance to Idaho public colleges and universities directly from the State Board of Education, a measure intended to smooth the transition to postsecondary education. The University of Idaho followed up by leading a statewide “Enroll Idaho” initiative, fanning out across Idaho to spread information and awareness about options for life after high school.<br><br>At Enroll Idaho on November 10, UI delivered a strong message about the value of going on to higher education to more than 420 students and 330 parents, from Boundary County in the north to Bear Lake County in the southeast and all points in between. I had the pleasure of returning to Grangeville to talk with high school seniors there and then visiting Coeur d’Alene that night.<br><br>You’ll find a lot of information about the value of postsecondary attainment in this video <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HP6QM8Hcs4"" >(link)</a>  we made for the event, but here’s a little bit of what we told people about going on to college: We know that a high-quality college education, the kind you find at UI, is transformative for people’s lives. To be clear, a college degree is not right for everyone. But for many, it is a critical ingredient in the recipe for a great life. Through higher education, students unlock the talent and creativity that inform a life of purpose and initiative. It’s an opportunity to make life-long friends, to see the world, and to grow as a leader.<br><br>Students who graduate from college emerge as critical thinkers and problem-solvers, qualities that are in-demand for employers, no matter what field you enter. The lifetime earnings difference among those who have a college degree and those who do not was recently estimated at $830,000 by the Federal Reserve <a href=""http://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2014/may/is-college-worth-it-education-tuition-wages/"" >(link)</a> , a wide gap this is only getting wider. The great jobs of today and tomorrow increasingly demand a college degree and the skills and perspectives that come with it. Beyond financial stability, though, a well-paying job leads to increased well-being <a href=""http://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/164108/college-worth.aspx"" >(link)</a>  in professional life, in personal satisfaction and in civic engagement. In short, doors open for college graduates – pathways to an exciting future.<br><br>Postsecondary education also unleashes a bright future for our state. A vibrant economy starts with an educated workforce, as our economy moves in a knowledge- and information-based direction. Those are the jobs that will build prosperity for our communities, and will provide opportunities for young people ready to start careers and families.<br><br>Taking the next steps toward college may seem daunting, but it doesn’t need to be. I encourage students and families to examine resources about how to go to college <a href=""https://nextsteps.idaho.gov/for-families/"" >(link)</a> , as well as how to assess which institution <a href=""https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/"" >(link)</a>  and which course of study <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/degree-finder?utm_source=112015&utm_medium=email&utm_content=degree_finder&utm_campaign=friday-letter15"" >(link)</a>  is right for them. UI is going to follow up the Enroll Idaho effort with outreach – FAFSA workshops, recruiting events and more – that help us reshape the college-going culture in our state. I encourage students and families to ask questions and explore. We’re here to listen and answer questions. The way forward for a great life may be closer than you think. 	<br> <img src=""../images/ab869efb-0378-42c0-8506-5f9b6dd580f2.jpg"" > 	<br>Go Vandals!<br><br>Chuck Staben<br>President 	<br>P.S. I’ll return with the next Friday Letter on December 4. Continuing an annual tradition, our School of Family and Consumer Sciences students have put together a list of Vandal recipes <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/advancement/departments/donor-relations/thanksgiving-recipes?utm_source=112015&utm_medium=email&utm_content=adv-deprts-donor_relations-tday_recipes&utm_campaign=friday-letter15"" >(link)</a>  for Thanksgiving.

She and her husband, Dick ’70, made a gift to support the library’s first floor remodel. The $1.3 million project, scheduled for completion in spring 2016, addresses the demand for technology-rich, collaborative learning spaces. “The Wittmans’ gift recognizes the vital role the library plays in attracting and retaining students,” said Dean Lynn Baird. “Offering students quality learning environments with access to top-rate technology gives them a competitive edge in the workplace. We are very grateful to the Wittmans for their generosity.” Dawn, a member of the UI Library Advisory Board, retired as executive director of the Lewiston City Library in 2012 and was recognized as Idaho’s Librarian of the Year.

2015-12-04,UI Leads the Way in Outdoor Adventure,"December 4, 2015 	<br> <img src=""../images/78d0092c-6b67-41ab-8113-fb516677185b.jpg"" > 	<br>Dear Friends, 	<br>Our state is filled with a remarkable abundance of mountains, canyons, rivers and wide-open spaces. With nearly unlimited opportunities for exploration, there is no better launching pad for educational and inspirational adventure than the University of Idaho. That’s a discovery I’ve been fortunate to make, alongside students, faculty and staff, alumni and community members from across the state.<br> <br>Last week, while many of us were staying warm over turkey and other holiday favorites <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/uidaho/posts/10153793168200996"" >(link)</a> , a UI Outdoor Program <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/campus-recreation/outdoor-program?utm_source=12415&utm_medium=email&utm_content=outdoor-program&utm_campaign=friday-letter15"" >(link)</a>  group was braving the elements in the Owyhee Canyonlands in southwest Idaho. The 10 hardy souls — students, student leaders, program staff, an alumnus and a visiting professor — hiked and camped throughout this new wilderness area in a remote part of the state, exploring the sagebrush steppes and the austere river canyons. The multi-day trip was one of many “Iconic Idaho” recreational opportunities through our Outdoor Program that showcase the unique and diverse natural splendor of Idaho. The 40-year-old Outdoor Program office at UI, led by Director Trevor Fulton, is nationally recognized <a href=""https://www.aore.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=137:award-history&catid=20:site-content&Itemid=178"" >(link)</a> . You couldn’t ask for a better guide to Idaho’s wild spaces.<br> <br>Those programs do more than offer recreation, though. They help students build a foundation of technical skills that they can apply to future endeavors. They offer opportunities for students to practice leadership. Student leaders work with staff to plan and execute trips, helping others cultivate a passion for the outdoors. Other skill development includes problem-solving, critical thinking and good decision-making. Not all student participants are recreation majors; in fact, many if not most are pursuing other disciplines, from business to engineering and more. Faculty members, UI staff, and alumni can also participate in trips.<br> <br>It’s important to dispel a few myths when discussing our Outdoor Programs. First, none of us are born adventurers or explorers, so most of the programs are designed to serve the absolute beginner while still offering value to more experienced participants. Affordability is another concern, no doubt. But whether it’s a trip or the rental of equipment from our well-stocked Outdoor Rental Center <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/campus-recreation/outdoor-program/rental-center?utm_source=12415&utm_medium=email&utm_content=outdoor-rental-center&utm_campaign=friday-letter15"" >(link)</a>  — one of the largest such rental shops in the country — the Outdoor Programs office runs on a strictly non-profit basis, with costs that students will find within their reach. (A simple overnight trip might be $25, and a weeklong trip under $200, for instance.)<br> <br>I bring up that commitment to accessibility and affordability because I know that students and other adults might find pursuing new skills and experiences — whether it’s skiing, kayaking, backcountry camping and more — a little daunting. But pushing yourself with new experiences is what higher education is all about. There is more to college than what you’ll find between the walls of a classroom or laboratory. Taking a facilitated trip, renting equipment to explore on your own, or even just using the climbing wall <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/campus-recreation/outdoor-program/climbing-center?utm_source=12415&utm_medium=email&utm_content=rec-center-climbing-wall&utm_campaign=friday-letter15"" >(link)</a>  at the Student Recreation Center are great ways to relieve stress and begin developing into the person you want to be, physically and mentally. It’s all part of a well-rounded college experience.<br> <br>We have another holiday coming up, and a winter break. Want a break from cabin fever? The Student Recreation Center is open, with many opportunities for families and community members. Climb a wall. Tune up a pair of skis. Learn more about a winter or spring trip with Outdoor Programs — sign-up begins the first day of spring semester.

2015-12-11,Vandal Excellence – There’s an App for That,"December 11, 2015 	<br> <img src=""../images/78d0092c-6b67-41ab-8113-fb516677185b.jpg"" > 	<br>Dear Friends, 	<br>This week nearly 700 Vandals <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2015-november/113015-fallcommencement?utm_source=121115&utm_medium=email&utm_content=news_commencement&utm_campaign=friday-letter15"" >(link)</a>  approach the commencement stage as students, cross it as graduates and leave it as proud, degree-holding members of the Vandal family. Students have earned degrees at the baccalaureate, master’s, doctoral and specialist levels, across a broad spectrum of disciplines, as you’d expect from a comprehensive research university like ours. It’s another chapter in the story of the University of Idaho, one written by each student — in some cases, literally.<br> <br>I have presided over a few of these ceremonies now, but it is still rewarding to see students achieve a goal for which they worked long and hard. If you’ve attended commencement, you might be familiar with the train of graduates, segmented by college, that enters the building at the start of the ceremony — a processional. The banner for each college is held by what we refer to as a highlight student, a graduate who has demonstrated the diligence, initiative and expertise to represent his or her college. I congratulate these students on their accomplishments.<br> <br>As one example of this Vandal excellence, the processional highlight student for the College of Natural Resources is rangeland ecology and management major Justin Trujillo. Justin is a non-traditional student who came to UI to complete his bachelor’s degree and further his career. During his time with the Rangeland Center <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/cnr/rangeland-center/about"" >(link)</a> , he noticed that there was no field guide for grasses. Instead of waiting for someone else to make one, he spent his undergraduate career taking photos, finding the funding and working with others to create a reference book.<br> <br>In this day and age, of course, a book needs to find a way to fit on our phones, so Justin is now working with a partner to build a phone app. Picture hiking in Idaho, and being able to identify pieces of the diverse landscape around you, with just a glance down at your phone. Landowners, management professionals and recreational users can all benefit. That breakthrough is a testament to problem-solving, teamwork and leadership.<br> <br>It’s also proof positive of what a college experience can do. Vandals crossing the stage today have exercised similar initiative in countless settings, in the classroom and outside of it. They’ve opened their minds to new ideas, and engaged in hands-on research, scholarly activity and creative work alongside expert professors. They’ve practiced discipline and honed the self-efficacy that will guide them in their careers. They’ve learned about issues and concerns outside of their own interests, giving back to communities <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/student-involvement/volunteer"" >(link)</a>  near and far through service.<br> <br>I know our students will take those experiences with them after tomorrow. They’ll contribute their skills and passion to making the world a better place — indeed, they already have. 	<br> <img src=""../images/ab869efb-0378-42c0-8506-5f9b6dd580f2.jpg"" > 	<br>Go Vandals!<br><br>Chuck Staben<br>President 	<br>	<br> <img src=""../images/d329a9c8-6907-4172-8ec6-c529ed12ce69.jpg"" > 	<br><br>THE LATEST NEWS FROM UI <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news"" >(link)</a> <br><br>	<br><br>Backing Crucial Graduate Student Education<br><br>To recognize the impact that a University of Idaho education had on the lives of her and her late husband, Joy Irving ’64 recently named the UI as a $1.3 million beneficiary of her estate.

2016-01-08,New Report Showcases UI’s Economic Impact,"January 8, 2016 	<br> <img src=""../images/78d0092c-6b67-41ab-8113-fb516677185b.jpg"" > 	<br>Dear Friends, 	<br>Welcome to an exciting new year with the University of Idaho. Our family vacationed together, but I am glad to be back in Moscow, rested and ready for a great semester. I often speak to students about the value of a college degree in financial and personal terms, urging them to invest in themselves. Early in the New Year, I’ll speak to committees of the Idaho Legislature, and I’ll urge them to invest in the University of Idaho, as a way to ensure and enhance its many economic and societal benefits.<br><br>I’d like to begin 2016 by sharing a new report by Economic Modeling Specialists International (EMSI) <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/president/news/economic_impact"" >(link)</a> , a leader in economic modeling based in Moscow, showing just how much UI contributes to the economic well-being of Idaho. The EMSI report gives us a global view of the university, showing that UI’s economic impact is varied and far-ranging. The university generates economic activity through research that benefits industry, through operations across the state and through delivering a transformative education to students. Our new report shows a strong surge in total annual impact – $1.1 billion. That amounts to 1.9 percent of Idaho’s economy, as measured by Gross State Product (GSP).<br><br>What specifically drives this impact? Operations spending, including our 3,000 full- and part-time employees, is a part of the story, as is research spending. However, the majority of the impact, some $782 million, comes from Vandal alumni. That is the direct result of former students taking their skills, perspectives and experience to Idaho employers. Vandal graduates are earning higher wages courtesy of their UI degree, they are helping businesses reach new levels of output, and they are putting more money from those higher wages back into the economy.<br><br>To understand the university’s impact in this way is essentially to assess our role in workforce development. That’s a key part of what we do as an institution, and this report shows that our performance should give us a lot of pride. Creating opportunities for students to live up to their potential and contribute to organizations and communities across the state is the central piece of UI’s economic impact. It’s also at the heart of our land-grant mission. While there is more to the university than a dollars and cents analysis shows, we should be pleased that the leadership and commitment that is our heritage and our future can be so convincingly demonstrated in economic terms.<br><br>The University of Idaho, our state’s public, land-grant institution, offers outstanding return on investment. For students, the increase in lifetime earnings they’ll see with their degree is more than $844,200, an impressive 14 percent annual rate of return. For taxpayers considering the merits of supporting our public university, consider that “for every $1 of public money invested in UI, taxpayers receive a cumulative value of $2.40 over the course of the students’ working lives.” The annual return rate taxpayers will realize is 8.2 percent, “a solid investment that compares favorably with other long-term investments in both the private and public sectors.” Lastly, one must consider the social perspective of having more educated citizens – better health, less crime and more employment. These social savings and added income pay off for the state many times over the initial investment.<br><br>Graduates of the University of Idaho know well how their lives were changed. I have met many who have described the new perspectives, attitudes and maturity forged at UI that shaped who they are today. For Vandals, it’s about more than dollars and cents. But we shouldn’t shy away from touting the economic benefits the university brings to citizens and to the state as a whole. In fact, I think that for too long we’ve undersold our critical role in workforce development and in the economy.<br><br>Our public university is not an expense, nor is it a luxury. It is an investment, and an absolutely critical foundation for prosperity. We will work hard to strengthen that foundation in the year ahead. 	<br> <img src=""../images/ab869efb-0378-42c0-8506-5f9b6dd580f2.jpg"" > 	<br>Go Vandals!<br><br>Chuck Staben<br>President 	<br>P.S.: This semester the President’s Office has joined Facebook! <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/uidahopresident/"" >(link)</a>  Follow me there for updates about the success of our students and faculty members, the progress of initiatives and programs, and the trends that impact higher education and Idaho. 	<br>	<br> <img src=""../images/d329a9c8-6907-4172-8ec6-c529ed12ce69.jpg"" > 	<br><br>THE LATEST NEWS FROM UI <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news"" >(link)</a> <br><br>	<br><br>Teaching the Spirit of Giving Back<br><br>You’ve probably heard a number of the inspiring stories of alumni, but you may not know that many current students also give back to the University of Idaho. Wil Everly, the UI Student Foundation President, has worked during his two-year tenure to raise student awareness of the importance of philanthropy to the success of the University of Idaho. Each year the Student Foundation encourages graduating seniors to make a Senior Class Gift (this year $20.16), providing students an opportunity to give back to a scholarship or program that inspired them while they were here. “It’s a great way to say ‘Thank You’ and start a tradition of giving back to the UI,” said Everly.

Yee recently created the Boyd Yee and Daisy Nebeker Yee Family Endowment in the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences. “During the last few years, I have been an enthusiastic donor to the Steer-A-Year program headed by Carl Hunt,” said Yee. “This friendship and participation with UI Extension has led to the creation of my endowment and is a way to honor my late wife of 39 years, Daisy.” Yee also donated a valuable Chinese-American artifact and family heirloom, the “Kang Youwei Board,” to the UI Asian American Comparative Collection. Boyd’s father, a Chinese herbalist, previously used the board in his Boise shop. Boyd, who worked for the Bureau of Land Management for 25 years before retiring, currently owns a cow/calf operation and raises quality hay.

The projects were judged on how their designs demonstrated a creative solution and knowledgeable application of integrated design and an innovative use of wood. Caleb Ehly of Sandpoint won the competition and received a first place plaque and $500. William Juarez of Filer and Nick Buckley of Boise earned merit awards for second and third place designs and each received plaques and $250. Ehly’s elegant winning design used five native Idaho woods: Douglas fir for Glulam beams in tension as the main support; lodgepole pine as rigid structure; western hemlock for flooring and finish; ponderosa pine for finishing, trim and detail; and western red cedar harvested from burned forest for charcoaled siding. This is the fourth year the Idaho Forest Products Commission has sponsored a Best Use of Idaho Wood competition to urge professional and student architects to encourage, recognize and support the creative and innovative use of Idaho wood in architectural design. <br><br>Pave the Road with Silver and Gold<br><br>The University of Idaho Office of Alumni Relations is encouraging all alumni, friends and business owners to help create a Vandal-colored path to Moscow for all those students and their families visiting UI in April for our UIdaho Bound enrollment events <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/events/uidaho-bound?utm_source=010816&utm_medium=email&utm_content=events-uidaho_bound&utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" >(link)</a> .

2016-01-15,Making the Grade on the College Scorecard,"January 15, 2016 	<br> <img src=""../images/78d0092c-6b67-41ab-8113-fb516677185b.jpg"" > 	<br>Dear Friends, 	<br>Many of you have likely witnessed the proliferation of yearly college rankings, ratings and lists, all purporting to add information and insight. Instead of clarification, however, confusion is often the result. Why is an institution ranked in the top 50 of one list, but not in the top 50 of another, similar list? What methodologies are being employed, and how do they differ from list to list? What metrics are valuable for which user? As a student or parent, you’d almost have to make a part time job of sorting out and verifying competing claims and distinctions.<br><br>That shouldn’t be the case, and it doesn’t have to be. I have found that the federal government’s new College Scorecard <a href=""https://collegescorecard.ed.gov"" >(link)</a>  report offers clarity, based on credible data, about three critical measures: affordability for students and families, graduation rates, and earnings after college. The first measure, affordability, indicates the degree of access to a transformative education. The second and third measures, graduation rates and earnings, highlight two of the most important outcomes of a college experience.<br><br>For students, for families, and for taxpaying citizens of the state of Idaho, these three measures get to the heart of the matter: Are we serving students and our public well? At the University of Idaho, the answer is a resounding yes. Look at the public, four-year universities in Idaho. UI’s average net cost is the lowest in the state, with the lowest net cost among all four-year public institutions for families with annual income under $48,000 per year. Our six-year graduation rate is the highest in the state. And for a UI graduate, earnings 10 years after graduation are much higher than other institutions. (UI fares similarly well when compared with private institutions.) In each measure, we outperform the national average.<br><br>These easy-to-read charts showcase UI’s delivery of an excellent education at an affordable price – a value for our students and for our state.<br><br>Beyond those comparisons, the scorecard offers a breakdown of University of Idaho performance on a number of valuable measures. Interested in freshman-to-sophomore retention as an indicator of “fit” and student support? Our retention rate is 79 percent, above the national average. (For Fall 2015, our data shows an increase to 80 percent.) Concerned about debt after college? UI students who take on debt successfully pay it down at rates well above the national average. I encourage students and families to explore the site, make comparisons, and assess what’s important for their individual and family circumstances. We welcome the scrutiny.<br><br>Importantly, the data are based on students who received federal financial aid. That means those students who need and receive support in attaining a college degree – including many first-generation college attendees and students from rural areas – receive an outstanding return on their investment from UI. These students will experience firsthand how UI contributes to social mobility <a href=""http://www.socialmobilityindex.org/"" >(link)</a> . They will go on to lives with greater financial stability, with greater satisfaction <a href=""https://www.luminafoundation.org/files/resources/galluppurdueindex-report-2014.pdf"" >(link)</a>  at work and in their personal endeavors, and with stronger rates of civic engagement. They will, in short, be on a pathway to realizing the American Dream. <br><br>The College Scorecard showcases how the University of Idaho is focused on making an outstanding education accessible to more Idaho students. For other Idaho citizens, UI supporters and education professionals, insight into how their state’s leading, national research university is performing with taxpayer dollars is a down payment toward credibility and confidence. For affordability, for graduation rates and for success after college, UI stands out in Idaho and across the region. 	<br> <img src=""../images/ab869efb-0378-42c0-8506-5f9b6dd580f2.jpg"" > 	<br>Go Vandals!<br><br>Chuck Staben<br>President 	<br>P.S.: This semester the President’s Office has joined Facebook! <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/uidahopresident/"" >(link)</a>  Follow me there for updates about the success of our students and faculty members, the progress of initiatives and programs, and the trends that impact higher education and Idaho. 	<br>	<br> <img src=""../images/d329a9c8-6907-4172-8ec6-c529ed12ce69.jpg"" > 	<br><br>THE LATEST NEWS FROM UI <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news"" >(link)</a> <br><br>	<br><br>Supporting the UI through the VSF<br><br>Studies have shown that successful athletic programs lead to enrollment growth, positive student experiences, and higher levels of alumni involvement.

The study demonstrates the university’s mission to understand and meet the needs of the state’s residents. “This new study is a valuable resource that will help our state understand the challenges we face in promoting postsecondary attendance,” Staben said. “We are deeply invested in addressing this issue, and this study gives us up-to-date information to create effective policy and guide decision-making, as one key part of continuing to build an educated and prosperous Idaho.” <br><br>UI Opens New Cybersecurity Training Center<br><br>It sounds like a state-of-the-art burrow in a Tom Clancy techno thriller – the Cybersecurity Training and Operations Center.

2016-01-22,An Investment We Can’t Afford Not To Make,"January 22, 2016 	<br> <img src=""../images/78d0092c-6b67-41ab-8113-fb516677185b.jpg"" > 	<br>Dear Friends, 	<br>Next week I will present the University of Idaho’s budget priorities before committees of the Idaho Legislature, sharing the story of our success and how we can build on that excellence. As our state’s land-grant institution, UI conducts teaching and learning, research and discovery, and outreach and Extension. Our ability to meet these responsibilities with effectiveness and strong fiscal stewardship means that public support of the University of Idaho is a sound investment in a great future.<br> <br>What do we mean by “investment”? The economic impact report <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/president/news/economic_impact"" >(link)</a>  I shared two weeks ago offers some insight. Across the board, UI delivers return on investment <a href=""https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/"" >(link)</a>  for our students, our citizens and our state. The report convincingly demonstrates that higher education is not a luxury, and it is not an expense. It is the foundation for our shared prosperity. At the legislature, I will explore the success of previous years of investments, and make the case for programs and initiatives that will allow us to do more.<br> <br>Last week, Governor Otter offered his budget recommendations <a href=""https://gov.idaho.gov/mediacenter/speeches/sp_2016/SOS_FY2017.pdf"" >(link)</a>  as part of the State of the State Address. Though not directive, these recommendations often form the basis of legislative appropriations. The governor’s budget includes an increase in the Opportunity Scholarship, a new Completion Scholarship and an innovative Tuition Lock program.  These programs offer ways to expand access to higher education. The tuition lock program provides stability and predictability for Idaho students and families, and it is philosophically consistent with commitments we have made as a university to ensure access and affordability.<br> <br>The Governor also recommended a change in employee compensation of 3 percent, which will help us remain competitive in attracting and retaining outstanding educators and researchers, essential to the excellence of the student experience and our ability to do great work for Idaho.<br> <br>Specific UI requests focus on enhancing our teaching and research missions. Our Complete College Idaho: Go On initiative bolsters the advising, counseling and supplemental instruction that helps students succeed in college. The effort will help ensure on-time graduation and improved student retention. On each of those measures, UI is the state’s leader among public institutions, but expanded capacity means we can set the bar higher.<br> <br>The Governor also recommended five additional seats and increased funding for Idaho WWAMI — Idaho’s medical school. Through the Idaho WWAMI program, aspiring physicians from our state receive training in partnership with one of the best medical programs in the country, the national leader in family and rural medicine. With a shortage of physicians across our state, especially in rural areas, we’re fortunate to have a partnership that sees more than 50 percent of Idaho students return home to Idaho communities to practice medicine. Funding the Idaho WWAMI program is a much-needed investment in the health and well-being of our state.<br> <br>As a comprehensive research university, we have other areas of need for which I’ll advocate. Those needs include maintenance and operation funds for facilities, such as our new Aquaculture Research Institute laboratory that delivers research expertise for our state’s world-class trout industry and hands-on learning for students, and for the new Integrated Research and Innovation Center (IRIC) that will propel interdisciplinary problem-solving and discovery for all of Idaho. We advocated for, and the Governor recommended, investments in our Idaho Geological Survey, in Forest Utilization Research, and in agricultural research that support the backbone of Idaho’s economy.<br> <br>We appreciate the governor’s recognition of the excellence these initiatives help our university achieve, and how they help our state meet its short- and long-term goals for success and prosperity. The legislative process is a long process that usually culminates in March, but our first steps are promising. 	<br> <img src=""../images/ab869efb-0378-42c0-8506-5f9b6dd580f2.jpg"" > 	<br>Go Vandals!<br><br>Chuck Staben<br>President 	<br>	<br> <img src=""../images/d329a9c8-6907-4172-8ec6-c529ed12ce69.jpg"" > 	<br><br>THE LATEST NEWS FROM UI <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news"" >(link)</a> <br><br>	<br><br>HP Inc. Gifts $60,000 in New Technology<br><br>Thanks to a generous gift from HP Inc., the newly renovated College of Education building will be equipped with cutting-edge technology to enable creativity, engagement and productivity. The gift includes a complete podium-based technology suite, study spaces with table-mounted HP monitors, a mobile cart loaded with HP Chromebooks, HP printers on three floors, and two interactive, updatable touchscreens displays placed at building entrances to feature events, provide degree program information, and share inspiring stories across the university. “This gift helps ensure that the education building features state-of-the-art equipment that encourages student and faculty collaboration, as well as pride in a very high-tech, modern facility for the campus and for College of Education students,” said Cori Mantle-Bromley, dean of the College of Education.

Understanding earnings potential helps students choose a school that will be an investment in their long-term financial security and that will spur opportunities to find personally meaningful careers. University of Idaho alumni earn the highest salaries early career and mid-career salaries of graduates from any public four-year institution in Idaho. UI awards the highest percentage of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) degrees in the state, and graduates report a high degree of meaning in their professional lives. Among Idaho public and private four-year institutions, only BYU-Idaho records higher early career salaries, though Vandal grads in mid-career earn more. One PayScale list compares those with only a bachelor’s degree, and another compares those with a master’s degree. On each list, UI and Vandal graduates lead the way in Idaho and fare very well in the region.  <br><br>Pilot Program Brings Diverse Students to UI Law<br><br>The University of Idaho College of Law is one of four law schools around the nation participating in a new program <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2016-january/012116-cleoprogram"" >(link)</a>  aimed at increasing diversity among law professionals. Created by the Council on Legal Education Opportunity (CLEO), the Legally Inspired Cohort (CLIC) is a pilot program that will recruit individuals from a range of backgrounds and offer continuous academic, financial and other support services through their first year of law study. The College of Law’s entering juris doctor (JD) Class of 2015 is 41 percent female, 59 percent male and 16 percent multicultural. As one of the four partners in this pilot program, the college will prepare even more historically underrepresented minorities, economically disadvantaged individuals, and first-generation college students to attend law school and succeed in the legal profession. Students accepted to the program will receive a $5,000 out-of-state tuition waiver from the UI College of Law and $500 from CLEO to cover enrollment costs. Each student studying at UI will also be assigned a third-year law student as a mentor. <br>	<br> <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/email-preferences"" >(link)</a>  	Subscribe to the Friday Letter, update your preferred UI email subscriptions. <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/email-preferences"" >(link)</a>  	<br>Office of the President | 875 Perimeter Drive MS 3151 | Moscow ID 83844-3151<br><br>Copyright © 2016 University of Idaho, All rights reserved.<br>You are receiving this email because of your affiliation with the University of Idaho.<br><br><br>         <br><br>	<br> "

                            This week Vandals converged on our state Capitol for “Higher Education Week.” It’s a time for sharing the University of Idaho story with our Legislature, meeting future Vandals at our annual downtown Boise recruiting event, and recognizing our great alumni at the Ada County Silver and Gold Awards celebration.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I was proud to <a href=""http://bit.ly/2kuGTRx "" target=""_blank"" style=""mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Arial, Calibri, sans-serif;color: #b18e5f;font-weight: normal;text-decoration: underline;"">explain UI’s progress</a> with members of the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee and the Senate and House education committees. I reminded them that the University of Idaho continues to be an outstanding investment, a public higher education experience that brings return on investment many times over in the lives of students, in research that propels our economy and in engagement that touches every community in Idaho. We have made great progress in enrolling more students and in conducting research of unmatched quality and scale in our state.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
For the coming year, our priorities gained the support of Gov. Otter, which I shared with the Legislature. State investment in adult completion scholarships will encourage nontraditional students to re-enroll. A change in employee compensation will allow us to recruit and retain talented Vandals. The governor supports the exciting <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/research/entities/cafe"" target=""_blank"" style=""mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Arial, Calibri, sans-serif;color: #b18e5f;font-weight: normal;text-decoration: underline;"">Center for Agriculture, Food and the Environment</a> project near Twin Falls. We’re also focusing on building a fourth-year to the program that allows students to complete an <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/engr/degrees-and-programs/cda"" target=""_blank"" style=""mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Arial, Calibri, sans-serif;color: #b18e5f;font-weight: normal;text-decoration: underline;"">undergraduate computer science degree in Coeur d’Alene</a>, and on investing in our <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/cals/research-and-extension"" target=""_blank"" style=""mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Arial, Calibri, sans-serif;color: #b18e5f;font-weight: normal;text-decoration: underline;"">Agricultural Research and Extension Service</a> and other special programs.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
This week was also a chance to watch the full circle of the Vandal experience, from new student to proud alumni. Wednesday night we had a well-attended <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/events/meet-the-vandals/about"" target=""_blank"" style=""mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Arial, Calibri, sans-serif;color: #b18e5f;font-weight: normal;text-decoration: underline;"">“Meet the Vandals”</a> recruiting event. I enjoyed meeting the many young women and men looking to make a decision about where to attend college. They heard from me and our great recruiting team about why UI is the best choice for higher education. I look forward to seeing them on campus next fall.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Thursday night we celebrated at our <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2017-january/012317-silverandgold"" target=""_blank"" style=""mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Arial, Calibri, sans-serif;color: #b18e5f;font-weight: normal;text-decoration: underline;"">Ada County Silver and Gold dinner</a>. Two great Vandals were honored: Doug Gross, winner of the Silver and Gold Award, and Howard Foley, our Jim Lyle Award winner. Each exemplifies Vandal success in professional life, and in a commitment to the University of Idaho. I am proud to consider Doug and Howard personal friends, and it was an honor to present them their well-deserved awards.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Seeing the silver and gold around Boise during “Higher Education Week” is always special. Thank you to the Vandals new and not-so-new who helped make it a meaningful week.

Each chapter is filled with passionate volunteers who are dedicated to ensuring the success of Idaho athletics. Over the past five years, Washington’s Puget Sound VSF chapter members have diligently worked to revitalize their organization and grow membership. Under the leadership of President Robie G. Russell ’78, and with a dedicated board of Vandals, the chapter has held watch parties, fundraising auctions and other special events to raise money for student-athlete scholarships. Their most recent event, the Legend’s Dinner and auction in Seattle prior to last fall's UI vs. Washington Husky football game, was a huge success, raising over $50,000 for the VSF. Booster chapter members provide invaluable support by giving of their time, treasure and talent.

The Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival will celebrate its 50th year with a unique set honoring Lionel Hampton’s and Benny Goodman’s careers on Friday, Feb. 24. The Hampton-Goodman Tribute features Stefon Harris on vibraphone, Anat Cohen on clarinet, Joe Doubleday on vibraphone and Felix Peikli on clarinet. Up-and-coming stars Doubleday and Peikli will perform works in a style reminiscent of the Benny Goodman Quartet of the 1930s. Immediately after, Harris and Cohen will perform a contemporary rendition of the same work that reflects today’s most innovative trends in jazz. This juxtaposition embodies the heart of the festival’s theme – “Grounded in Tradition. Breaking New Ground.” Headlining the 2017 festival is four-time Grammy award-winner Esperanza Spalding, critically acclaimed vocal group New York Voices and returning artist and Grammy nominee René Marie and Experiment in Truth. Tickets are available through the University of Idaho Ticket Office located in the ASUI-Kibbie Activity Center, by phone at 1-888-8-UIDAHO or online at <a href=""https://tkt.xosn.com/tickets/TicketLanding.dbml?=&amp;DB_OEM_ID=17100"" target=""_blank"" style=""mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Arial, Calibri, sans-serif;color: #b18e5f;font-weight: normal;text-decoration: underline;"">www.uidaho.edu/ticketoffice</a>.

2016-01-29,Medical Education in Idaho,"January 29, 2016 	<br> <img src=""../images/78d0092c-6b67-41ab-8113-fb516677185b.jpg"" > 	<br>Dear Friends, 	<br>I would like to share some information on a complex issue: medical education in Idaho. Providing medical professionals to ensure the health of our citizens is an important educational mission. Healthcare encompasses many professions: physicians, nurses, pharmacists, physical therapists and more. This letter will focus on physician training or the medical doctorate (M.D.), in which UI plays a critical role. Understanding how medical education is delivered is necessary for making informed decisions about the future of such programs in Idaho – planning for smart and sustained growth.<br><br>The WWAMI program <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/academics/wwami"" >(link)</a>  is the primary MD training program in Idaho. WWAMI stands for “Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho” – a partnership between the state of Washington, its top-rated medical school at the University of Washington, and the four, more sparsely populated nearby states that do not have their own public medical schools. Through this program, Idaho students receive the M.D. degree from the University of Washington, nationally ranked No. 1 for primary care, No. 1 for family medicine, No. 1 for rural medicine, and highly ranked in many specialties and in research.<br><br>For three decades, Idaho had 20 WWAMI seats. Last year, that number rose to 35 Idaho students. And this year, UI requested state funds to enroll 40 students in the Idaho WWAMI program. That growth has contributed to success for students and to a healthier state.<br><br>Physician training is long, complex and requires a system of universities, medical schools and residency programs. An excellent resource from which I will draw much of my data is the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) 2015 State Physician Workforce Data Book <a href=""https://www.aamc.org/data/workforce/reports/442830/statedataandreports.html"" >(link)</a>  and related material on their website.<br><br>Preparation for Medical School – 4 years<br>Most aspiring physicians begin preparation for medical education as undergraduates in a bachelor’s degree program. Few colleges offer pre-medical majors, and prospective medical students may complete any degree program provided the requisite coursework in chemistry, biology, mathematics, physics and English is successfully completed before admission. Just over half of all students entering medical school in 2015 had completed a biology major, but many other majors are represented. All of Idaho’s four-year institutions offer appropriate prerequisite coursework for applying to medical school.<br><br>Medical School – 4 years<br>Physicians may hold an MD or Doctor of Osteopathy (D.O.) degree. As the degree that designates entry into the medical profession, these degree programs are considered Undergraduate Medical Education among medical schools, an often confusing term for a professional degree that follows bachelor’s degree attainment. Traditionally, medical school was a four-year educational curriculum that began with foundational basic sciences, and then introduced clinical experiences in hospitals and doctor’s offices as the curriculum progressed. Increasingly, new curricular approaches are integrating clinical work throughout training, requiring medical schools to have access to clinicians and clinical sites to permit such experiences.<br><br>Residency Training – 3-6 years<br>After completing an MD or DO program, almost all physicians pursue Graduate Medical Education, commonly referred to as residency training, for the purpose of establishing a specialty. Primary care residencies (Family Medicine, Internal Medicine, and Pediatrics) are typically three years of intense clinical experience in supervised settings. Other specialties, such as surgery or radiology, are typically six years and require even more specialized supervision. Many residencies are at academic medical centers, but they can also be at community hospitals. Idaho has residencies in Family Medicine based in Boise, Coeur d’Alene and Pocatello; in Internal Medicine in Boise; and in Psychiatry in Boise.<br><br>Physician Workforce Needs<br>The AAMC is concerned that current physician training may not produce enough doctors to meet the United States needs in the 21st century. AAMC data clearly indicate that Idaho’s physician pipeline is very limited, which is why the University of Idaho has been working hard to increase physician training on multiple fronts.<br><br>Idaho ranks 49th in physicians per capita. We have less than 20 percent of the national average of medical residents per capita, and reasonable estimates of medical students from Idaho – enrolled in programs across the U.S. – indicate that our state enrolls Idahoans in medical school at less than half the per capita national average. Idaho students applying to medical school are well-qualified, with MCAT test scores and grade point averages very similar to national peers, and they are admitted at rates similar to all premedical students.<br><br>In sum, for its population, Idaho has a low number of practicing physicians and a small, but growing MD production pipeline. While we strengthen that pipeline, we can continue building upon the Idaho WWAMI program’s strengths and expanding capacity.<br><br>The University of Idaho’s Current Role<br>The University of Idaho plays important roles at all three stages of the physician pipeline. It is not certain how many UI students attend medical school after graduation, but we know that about 10 percent of all WWAMI students studied at UI. Clearly, UI plays an important role in pre-medical (bachelor’s degree) education, one we plan to expand.<br><br>Second, the centerpiece of UI’s role in medical education is the Idaho WWAMI program. In this program, Idaho students, no matter where they attended undergraduate education, access the UW School of Medicine via the University of Idaho. They complete their first 18 months of physician training in Moscow and surrounding rural communities, facilitated by UI faculty and area physicians. That experience is followed by clinical clerkships in 178 locations across Idaho and other WWAMI states. Students then complete an eight-week clinical rotation in one of the University of Washington’s highly specialized quaternary care hospitals, and may choose clinical rotations throughout the WWAMI network. Fortunately, most Idaho WWAMI students complete the bulk of their MD training in Idaho.<br><br>Last, WWAMI graduates, like most physicians, will complete residencies before practicing. WWAMI staff play an integral role for the residencies in Idaho. Residency is often the primary determinant of where a physician will practice. We are fortunate that despite the limited residency opportunities currently available within the state, 51 percent of all Idaho WWAMI graduates have practiced or are practicing in Idaho.<br><br>I hope you see that the challenge of educating, attracting and retaining Idaho’s 21st-century physician workforce is a complex one. The University of Idaho is pleased to have a world-class partner in the University of Washington to help us meet that challenge, and we are proud to have rapidly increased the number of students admitted to pursue physician training.<br><br>We have a long history and exciting future in training Idaho’s next generation of physicians. We need to work collaboratively to find solutions for access to medical education. Together, we can overcome our state’s healthcare challenges and lead Idaho to a healthier tomorrow. 	<br> <img src=""../images/ab869efb-0378-42c0-8506-5f9b6dd580f2.jpg"" > 	<br>Go Vandals!<br><br>Chuck Staben<br>President 	<br>	<br> <img src=""../images/d329a9c8-6907-4172-8ec6-c529ed12ce69.jpg"" > 	<br><br>THE LATEST NEWS FROM UI <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news"" >(link)</a> <br><br>	<br><br>Gifts of Global Competency and Understanding<br><br>The Department of Modern Languages and Cultures in the College of Letters, Arts and Social Sciences (CLASS) connects University of Idaho students with a diverse and rapidly evolving world. Two recent leadership-level gifts will help to greatly accelerate this critical work. Recently, Richard ’73 and Barbara ’73 Dahl created the Barbara K. Dahl Endowment for Language Immersion to fund in-country language education for students studying abroad, and John Wallace ’78 created the Wallace Faculty Award in Modern Languages and Cultures to support high-quality instruction and leadership in the department. “Working together, these two extraordinarily generous gifts will ensure that our students will have the global skills and understanding to pursue life-changing work around the globe,” said Andrew Kersten, Dean of CLASS. Contact Peter Mundt, director of development, regarding giving opportunities in CLASS at (208) 885-5013 or peter@uidaho.edu <mailto:peter@uidaho.edu"" >(link)</a> . <br><br>UI Scores High for Social Mobility<br><br>On the 2015 Social Mobility Index <a href=""http://www.socialmobilityindex.org/"" >(link)</a> , the University of Idaho outperformed other public Idaho institutions. The ranking compares the extent to which a university helps financially disadvantaged students graduate into well-paying jobs. Affordable tuition, percentage of low-income students, graduation rates and alumni earnings all inform the rankings. UI was No. 113 nationwide, the highest score in Idaho, aided by its tops-in-the-state graduation rate and impressive median early-career salaries, the highest among public institutions. The top ranking marks the University of Idaho’s commitment to making an affordable education accessible to as many qualified Idaho students as possible. <br><br>UI Offers New Higher Education Doctoral Degree<br><br>Professionals working in higher education can maximize their potential to influence change and promote their institution through a new doctorate program <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2016-january/012716-newphd"" >(link)</a>  offered by the University of Idaho. The Leadership in Higher Education doctorate specialization through the College of Education is an advanced degree program meant for working professionals who want to further their leadership role. “This is the program where participants create networks of colleagues whose passions intersect, one where they meet and interact with leaders in place and where they become colleagues fully informed on the trends, policies, law and possibilities of today’s campuses,” said Cori Mantle-Bromley, dean of the College of Education. The four-year program will launch its inaugural cohort in summer 2016. Core topics in the curriculum include law and ethics, organizational development and change, finance and budgeting, social justice, contemporary issues, stewardship and governance and policy. Courses are primarily online with some in-person commitments required where students will interact with faculty members, peers and professionals in leadership positions. <br>	<br> <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/email-preferences"" >(link)</a>  	Subscribe to the Friday Letter, update your preferred UI email subscriptions. <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/email-preferences"" >(link)</a>  	<br>Office of the President | 875 Perimeter Drive MS 3151 | Moscow ID 83844-3151<br><br>Copyright © 2016 University of Idaho, All rights reserved.<br>You are receiving this email because of your affiliation with the University of Idaho.<br><br><br>         <br><br>	<br> "
2016-02-05,North Idaho Is Vandal Country,"February 5, 2016 	<br> <img src=""../images/78d0092c-6b67-41ab-8113-fb516677185b.jpg"" > 	<br>Dear Friends, 	<br>The University of Idaho is unique among colleges and universities in our state in that our teaching, research and outreach touch every corner of Idaho. From Priest Lake to Bear Lake, from Preston to Ponderay, and from Idaho Falls to Boise and beyond, Idaho is our campus. North Idaho, especially, is Vandal country. Our Coeur d’Alene center <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/cda"" >(link)</a>  offers opportunities for students, outreach that meets community needs, and workforce development that trains citizens for the jobs of today — and tomorrow.<br><br>The Coeur d’Alene center, located on the banks of the Spokane River not far from downtown, is a growing hub for outstanding educational experiences, including a complement of certificate options and bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral degrees. Many offerings, such as our Executive MBA program, are ideal for adults seeking to continue their educations while working. The physical landscape of higher education in Coeur d’Alene is changing to meet new growth, as a new joint-use building in collaboration with NIC and LCSC will bolster support services and help students get the most from their experiences.<br><br>The Coeur d’Alene center actively develops entrepreneurship and innovation. At our Post Falls Research Park <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/cda/research"" >(link)</a> , an emerging business incubator, we connect great ideas with the resources they need to accomplish big goals. North Idaho is embracing industries of the future, including cybersecurity. UI-CDA recently won a two-year state workforce training grant and has added private-sector support to launch the Cybersecurity Training and Operations Center <a href=""http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2016/jan/11/university-of-idaho-opens-new-cyber-security-train/"" >(link)</a> . The Post Falls center will train the next generation of in-demand employees to succeed in a risk-filled online world, helping them secure a bright future in a thriving sector of our economy. Cybersecurity is an emerging area of excellence at UI, and this center leverages that expertise for the entire community.<br><br>The Coeur d’Alene center also promotes tech savvy through the “Dign’IT” program, which includes coding camps for young people, a summer technology internship program for high school students, and STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts and math) labs for all age levels. UI-CDA houses the Idaho Regional Math Center, focusing on teacher professional development; a nonprofit leadership program; and a Community Water Resource Center that partners with experts and community members on water quality, research and education. The sponsorship of a community makerspace, Gizmo-CDA, rounds out our multi-faceted commitment to supporting the interests and needs of the community.<br><br>We’re lucky to have Charles Buck, associate vice president at the center, coordinating how we serve North Idaho from the center and from Moscow. He has built valuable relationships in the community, including taking a leadership role with CDA 2030, a collaborative project that helps groups and organizations work toward a common vision for a flourishing city. That work is a great example of the imaginative engagement our centers can bring to a community.<br><br>As in areas throughout the state, UI research and outreach and Extension are exploring solutions to complex problems and helping meet community needs. Research on water and natural resources continues to be important. In each of our Extension offices across the region, 4-H and other youth development programs continue to help young people grow as leaders and thinkers.<br><br>North Idaho is beautiful country.

Since beginning her tenure as dean in July 2010, Mantle-Bromley has experienced firsthand the power of private support by meeting with hundreds of donors. “I am humbled and inspired by the generosity and care of the most wonderful alumni and friends imaginable,” she said. As a Vandal and the academic leader of the college, Mantle-Bromley also felt strongly that she should make a personal investment. Her husband Keith, a retired educator, strongly supported the idea of a multi-year commitment toward the project which will offer a state-of-the-art facility to house expanded programs and offer UI’s students the best education possible.

Among public colleges and universities in the Northwest, only the University of Washington also made the list. The Princeton Review’s methodology includes the use of institutional and student surveys combined with PayScale’s alumni earnings data. Financial aid is an important component of the analysis — UI awarded more than $24 million in financial aid to students in fall 2015. According to The Princeton Review <a href=""https://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings/colleges-that-pay-you-back/methodology"" >(link)</a> , “Students who attend these schools don't have to mortgage their futures to pay for their degrees—and we believe they will graduate with great career prospects.” The rankings also reflect student opinions of teaching quality and the accessibility of professors. The Princeton Review concludes, “We strongly recommend and salute the colleges we present here for all that they do to help their students with need afford to attend them while delivering an amazing college experience that's worth every penny.” <br><br>UI Researchers Help Address Wildfire Research<br><br>The United States must make preparing for and adapting to wildfire a top national priority, says a team of University of Idaho researchers and their international partners in a new paper in the journal BioScience <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2016-february/020216-wildfireresearch"" >(link)</a> . The researchers issued a call for academia, government agencies, industries and communities to work together to address wildfire because it is a “wicked problem” — one so complex that a one-size-fits-all solution does not exist. “We need to help communities understand how to coexist with wildfire,” said lead author Alistair Smith, fire ecology and management program lead and director of research and graduate studies for the UI College of Natural Resources. “The partnerships have to cover agencies and universities and industries. We can’t fix this alone. We have to do this together.” U.S. wildfires burned more than 10.1 million acres in 2015 — a new record, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced last month. Those fires destroyed 4,500 homes and structures and killed 13 firefighters. Wildfire suppression costs the United States, on average, $2.9 billion a year. The cascading consequences — such as health problems from poor air quality, post-fire landslides or loss of tourism — add up to staggering additional costs, Smith said.

In an address to the legislature, the governor noted that citizens, “inspired with a commendable zeal for the furtherance of the cause of education in our Territory, have inaugurated a movement for the establishment of a university at Boise City, to be called the University of Idaho.” History had other plans, though, and higher education had to wait until 1889, when the University of Idaho was established amid the rolling hills of the Palouse in beautiful Moscow.<br><br>Still, for more than a century the University of Idaho has maintained a robust presence in Boise and southwestern Idaho. An agricultural extension program was the first Vandal flag planted in the city in 1910. Exciting research, dynamic extension services and outstanding educational offerings have flourished in southwestern Idaho ever since.<br><br>UI-Boise offers educational opportunities <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/boise/boise-academics"" >(link)</a>  for students at all stages. Our VandaLink transfer program <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/boise/boise-academics/transfers-vandalink"" >(link)</a> , recently bolstered with an additional $185,000 in need-based support, creates a smooth pathway between area community colleges and UI four-year options. Students can pursue a bachelor’s degree in areas such as dietetics, education and psychology, or advanced degrees in engineering, fire ecology and management, bioregional planning and community design, and many more. Our new Idaho Law and Justice Learning Center, in the former Ada County Courthouse, is home to second- and third-year law options, with a first-year program planned for 2017.<br><br>Research is another piece of our statewide mission. At the UI Water Center, the Center for Ecohydraulics Research anchors a thematic commitment to the study of water, natural resources and the environment in Idaho and the west. The Integrated Design Lab helps design high-performance, energy efficient buildings, an important goal for 21st-century sustainability. Our Confucius Institute is expanding to Boise to offer Chinese language and cultural instruction, a boon for students and business leaders alike. Our James A. and Louise McClure Center for Public Policy Research publishes policy briefs and other items <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/president/direct-reports/mcclure-center/publications/idaho-at-a-glance"" >(link)</a> ; its recent “Life After High School” report has attracted notice to the challenges Idaho faces in achieving its postsecondary education goals.

Researchers led by University of Idaho assistant professor of physics Matthew Hedman “weighed” the central parts of Saturn’s most massive ring for the first time, and the results suggest the ring is much less massive than some researchers had expected. In their analysis <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2016-february/020316-saturnresearch"" >(link)</a> , Cassini scientists found surprisingly little correlation between how dense a ring might appear to be — in terms of its opacity and reflectiveness — and the amount of material it contains. The new results concern Saturn's B ring, the brightest and most opaque of Saturn's rings, and are consistent with previous studies that found similar results for Saturn's other main rings. Hedman and his colleagues came to their conclusion by examining fine-scale features of the rings using a new technique to analyze data gathered from Cassini as it peered through the rings toward Gamma Crucis, a bright, red giant star in the Southern Cross constellation.

2016-02-19,Our Home in Idaho Falls and Southeastern Idaho,"February 19, 2016 	<br> <img src=""../images/78d0092c-6b67-41ab-8113-fb516677185b.jpg"" > 	<br>Dear Friends, 	<br>In the early 1950s, the first lights powered by nuclear technology flickered to life in the desert of southeastern Idaho. The region has grown and thrived ever since, and the University of Idaho has played a key role in that development. In Idaho Falls and southeastern Idaho <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/idaho-falls"" >(link)</a> , UI carries out an ambitious and exciting research agenda, in partnership with organizations such as the Idaho National Laboratory and others. We also provide an array of educational opportunities, especially advanced education, and engage with communities through our Extension network.<br><br>The Center for Advanced Energy Studies (CAES) <a href=""https://caesenergy.org/"" >(link)</a>  is a unique facility in Idaho Falls, promoting research that seeks solutions for renewable energy and training the next generation of experts. In partnership with the Idaho National Laboratory, UI is a leader among four institutions that come together to offer timely and innovative research, education and policy resources that have impact and benefits for our state. For example, the competitive Frontier for Research in Geothermal Energy (FORGE) <a href=""https://caesenergy.org/research/current-initiatives/"" >(link)</a>  grant examines the feasibility of establishing a geothermal laboratory in Idaho — a potentially very valuable resource for the entire region’s energy future. The Food, Water and Energy (FEW) nexus is also an important upcoming area of research, looking at the criticality of those resources in a changing world.<br><br>In most of these endeavors, the Idaho National Laboratory is a key player. The INL is a research and economic success story in the high plains of southeastern Idaho, and UI is proud to be an active partner in their efforts. Nuclear engineering is central to the work at UI-Idaho Falls. Rich Christensen joined UI in September as the director of nuclear engineering. With decades of experience at Ohio State University, Christensen and his team are fostering collaboration and responsiveness to industry needs, as they study everything from small nuclear reactors, to heat exchange, to the safety of nuclear systems and hybrid nuclear systems. We also serve the needs of the workforce in the region, including INL, offering their employees (and others) bachelor’s degrees in industrial technology and environmental science and master’s and doctoral-level education in multiple engineering and science-related disciplines.<br><br>Computer science is an area of excellence in southeastern Idaho. We have outstanding faculty in this area, including joint appointments with INL, who are seeing the needs of industry firsthand and are able to bring that perspective to students. New faculty member Michael Haney’s background in cybersecurity enables research collaboration with INL employees and gives students the best possible training they’ll need to take to employers, helping industry stay ahead of the game in this critical space.<br><br>We’re lucky to have the leadership of Executive Officer Marc Skinner at UI-Idaho Falls. Marc had previously worked at UI before serving as a faculty member and administrator at BYU-Idaho. He rejoined the Vandal family last summer, having forged great connections in the community and an understanding of the region’s educational offerings and needs. He’s involved with regional economic development, and recognizes how fast-growing and dynamic the region is — and how UI can serve that continued success. I’m excited about seeing the direction he’s able to take our research and education.<br><br>Lastly, I want to highlight our community engagement in southeastern Idaho. Through Extension, UI meets community needs in places like the Fort Hall Reservation, developing leaders there and across the region through programs such as 4-H. This is the often unseen work that is part of everyday life in town after town. We also recently hosted a community concert in Idaho Falls with the Lionel Hampton School of Music’s Jazz Band, Wind Ensemble and Idaho Brass Quintet. More than 500 people, including area high school students, attended the concert.<br><br>We’re proud to have an impact on the fabric of communities. UI employees don’t just have a passion for the land-grant mission of service to Idaho. We are community leaders, volunteers and dedicated citizens — wherever we are in this great state.<br><br>Idaho is our campus, we often say at UI. It is also our home. And we are proud to do all we can for the success of Idaho — our state, our home. 	<br> <img src=""../images/ab869efb-0378-42c0-8506-5f9b6dd580f2.jpg"" > 	<br>Go Vandals!<br><br>Chuck Staben<br>President 	<br>	<br> <img src=""../images/d329a9c8-6907-4172-8ec6-c529ed12ce69.jpg"" > 	<br><br>THE LATEST NEWS FROM UI <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news"" >(link)</a> <br><br><br>The Famous Kathleens Help Generations of Students<br><br>Kathleen Bailey Irwin ’37 and her daughter, Kay (Kathleen) Irwin Rowley ’63, ’87, are a generous mother and daughter team.

This signature UI event highlights some of the strengths of our university: our ability to bring culture and community together, our commitment to outreach and engagement with young people, and our opportunities for students to learn and excel through an experience they’d find no place else. It’s an exciting time filled with nearly 100 student-artist workshops, some 400 student performances and entertainment from leading lights of the music world.<br><br>The workshop and seminars over the course of the week give K-12 and UI students a chance to study with accomplished professionals, receiving mentorship and hands-on instruction. Secondary students visiting us this week also experience the college environment and have the opportunity to picture themselves succeeding at the University of Idaho. Not all of them will be music majors, of course, but we hope this experience opens up their idea of how accessible a college education is and how they can and should succeed in it.<br><br>This year the Jazz Fest experience has also come directly to high schools across the region through our Jazz in Schools <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/class/jazzfest/about/jazz-in-schools?name=friday_letter&utm_source=022616&utm_medium=email&utm_content=jazz_in_schools%20&utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" >(link)</a>  program. More than 8,000 students in dozens of schools participate in the program. It’s an outreach program that only a university of our reach and mission can and or would attempt, and of which we can all be justly proud. Those students in our small towns and larger cities are gaining a window into a uniquely American art form. Jazz is about improvisation and collaboration — as music, it perfectly embodies the “Pathways to Discovery” theme. Those lessons go well beyond music, of course, and can be applied to a wide range of endeavors both academic and personal.<br><br>This year we’re excited to welcome a diverse array of professional performers <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/class/jazzfest/about/artist-bios"" >(link)</a>  to the Palouse, including many Grammy winners. It’s a broad range of music, from jazz funk to big band, to swing, to blues and more. Already this week we’ve seen our talented performers from UI join nationally recognized musicians for two nights of concerts. This weekend will bring another two nights of exciting music from well-known performers — I hope you’ll join Mary Beth and me in attending these events. We enjoy the buzz of activity in the Moscow community around this special week.<br><br>The Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival is a remarkable, multifaceted event. I want to thank the faculty and staff members, students, and volunteers who make it possible year after year. We have a passionate and committed advisory board and other alumni who care about this festival and appreciate both the music and the opportunity to showcase our university.<br><br>The past half-century of music festivals offers us a heritage and history that we can draw from to invigorate the festival in coming years. The Jazz Fest has enriched our community and opened up new pathways for students for many years now — I look forward to the festival to come this weekend, and to the bright future we’ll discover together. 	<br> <img src=""../images/ab869efb-0378-42c0-8506-5f9b6dd580f2.jpg"" > 	<br>Go Vandals!<br><br>Chuck Staben<br>President 	<br>	<br> <img src=""../images/d329a9c8-6907-4172-8ec6-c529ed12ce69.jpg"" > 	<br><br>THE LATEST NEWS FROM UI <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news"" >(link)</a> <br><br><br>Avista Kick-Starts Endowment for Grand Challenges Engineering Scholars<br><br>The University of Idaho College of Engineering and Avista Corporation have launched a unique endowment to support UI Grand Challenges Scholars Program students — a new generation of engineers expressly equipped to tackle some of the most pressing issues facing society in the 21st century.

The explosives sensor McIlroy has developed incorporates nanosprings — telephone-cord shaped coils of silica 500 times thinner than a human hair — which McIlroy invented. McIlroy’s new project will focus on defining and understanding the underlying factors that make the sensor work, which opens the door to designing a more robust and reliable sensor. He will work with two graduate students and two undergraduate summer researchers. McIlroy’s sensor design uses xenon light bulbs — which cost just a few dollars and are commonly used in items such as overhead projectors — coated with nanosprings and a material that reacts with certain chemicals used to make explosives. The bulb provides heat to activate the reactive material, while the nanosprings provide a huge amount of surface area in a small space, allowing the sensor to react to extremely low concentrations of chemicals.

2016-03-04,Our Options for UI Football,"March 4, 2016 	<br> <img src=""../images/78d0092c-6b67-41ab-8113-fb516677185b.jpg"" > 	<br>Dear Friends, 	<br>This week you heard news about the discontinuation of our football team’s affiliation with the Sun Belt Conference <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2016-march/030116-sunbelt?name=friday-letter&utm_source=%20030416&utm_medium=email&utm_content=sunbelt&utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" >(link)</a>  after the 2017 season. While the timing of the Sun Belt’s decision was unexpected, we face the future with options, and with confidence that we will choose the right course for our university.<br> <br>Athletics is an important part of the University of Idaho. It serves as the “front porch” of our university and a place to build community. Athletics also provides opportunities for our student-athletes to excel in competition and in the classroom.<br> <br>I doubt that many institutions can match the loyalty and enthusiasm of our Vandal family. Football brings us together, something I enjoy every football Saturday in the fall. We created the Fan Zone — an iteration of which you’ll see again next fall — and set a course to build an arena for our court sports, because we know that a university’s excellence is measured in part by the quality of its Athletics programs, and we must invest in Athletics if we want to see positive results.<br> <br>I understand how important the conference affiliation decision is for our university. Over the course of the past year, in settings public and private, I communicated the value UI brings to the Sun Belt conference, and that our football program is on the upswing. Stability is very important in terms of finding a good conference fit for our university. And uncertain conference affiliation has challenged our ability to build the best possible program.<br> <br>I know that our alumni, students and fans have passionate opinions about the right place for Vandal football and that there is a good deal of disagreement about where we should be going forward. There is strong support for each of our two current options after 2017: 1) play as an independent member of the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) until we can stably affiliate with an appropriate FBS conference, or 2) accept an invitation to join the Big Sky Conference. No other option exists nor can we depend on other opportunities arising. The Big Sky has asked UI to join them, setting a May 4 deadline on their invitation. A decision whether to accept that invitation, subject to State Board approval, is forthcoming, and we will be open and straightforward in how and when we communicate our decision.<br> <br>The decision I make on behalf of the Vandal Family will be informed by what is best for our student-athletes, for our students and fans, and for our university. That means positioning our student-athletes to excel, securing the stability and autonomy we need to build a successful program for the long-term, and ensuring the very best student and fan experience possible.<br> <br>I went to 10 of 12 football games last season, so I’ve had a firsthand look at how hard our student-athletes compete and the progress that they are making. I’ve seen the positive fan experience that a good crowd and a victory brings to the Kibbie Dome (a top-10 college football venue <a href=""http://fanindex.usatoday.com/2015/10/17/the-10-stadiums-with-the-best-atmosphere-in-college-football/"" >(link)</a> , according to USA Today), and I’ve appreciated the vibrancy on campus and genuine uplift in university-wide morale that results.<br> <br>I will study our options and make the best decision for our university. We will build a future of football excellence at UI. We will build an arena to be an outstanding home for our court sports. I will count on our Vandal family to support that progress. No matter where our “front porch” is located, we will gather on it as Vandals — brave and bold. 	<br> <img src=""../images/ab869efb-0378-42c0-8506-5f9b6dd580f2.jpg"" > 	<br>Go Vandals!<br><br>Chuck Staben<br>President 	<br>	<br> <img src=""../images/d329a9c8-6907-4172-8ec6-c529ed12ce69.jpg"" > 	<br><br>THE LATEST NEWS FROM UI <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news"" >(link)</a> <br><br><br>A Tax-free Opportunity to Support UI<br><br>The IRA charitable rollover means that University of Idaho supporters can make a gift of up to $100,000 directly from an IRA to benefit UI – and it’s tax-free.

The program was approved by the State Board of Education on Feb. 18, one month after approval by the American Bar Association. The final step in approval is review by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities. A Master of Laws is an internationally recognized postgraduate law degree that can be completed in nine months. Law students often pursue the LL.M. to gain expertise in a specialized field of law. At UI, LL.M. students will be able to choose an emphasis in democracy, justice and the American legal system; natural resources and environmental law; business law and entrepreneurship; or litigation and alternative dispute resolution. “The addition of the LL.M. degree marks a significant academic expansion at the College of Law,” said Dean Mark L. Adams. <br><br>UI Alumna Named Woman of the Year<br><br>University of Idaho alumna Nora Carpenter has been named Woman of the Year for 2016 <a href=""https://idahobusinessreview.com/2016/02/26/50-women-leaders-inspire-a-crowd-of-600-at-women-of-the-year-event/"" >(link)</a>  by the Idaho Business Review. The president and CEO of United Way Treasure Valley was honored February 25 at a gala event at the Boise Centre. Carpenter was selected from among 50 distinguished nominees. The Women of the Year nominee class included four University of Idaho employees: Cori Mantle-Bromley, dean of the UI College of Education; Terri Muse, assistant dean for external relations at the UI College of Law in Boise; SeAnne Safaii-Waite, associate professor of family and consumer science for the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences at UI Boise and UI Coeur d’Alene; and Barbara Zanzig Lock, director of the Low Income Taxpayer Clinic and lecturer of tax law at the UI College of Law in Boise. The class included eight Vandal alumni. In addition to Carpenter, the nominees were: Colleen Asumendi Fillmore, state director, USDA Child Nutrition Programs, Boise; Johanna “Joey” Hale, director, internal audit, J.R. Simplot Company, Boise; Katherine Johnson, director of marketing and communications, Treasure Valley YMCA, Boise; Deneen May, vice president, Meridian Silverstone Financial Center, Zions Bank, Meridian; Amanda Watson, senior account executive, Red Sky, Boise; Mary York, partner, Holland & Hart LLP, Boise; and Beth Ineck, City of Nampa director of economic development. <br>	<br> <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/email-preferences"" >(link)</a>  	Subscribe to the Friday Letter, update your preferred UI email subscriptions. <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/email-preferences"" >(link)</a>  	<br>Office of the President | 875 Perimeter Drive MS 3151 | Moscow ID 83844-3151<br><br>Copyright © 2016 University of Idaho, All rights reserved.<br>You are receiving this email because of your affiliation with the University of Idaho.<br><br><br>         <br><br>	<br> "

But our impact does not stop at the state line. We are also a premier destination for students from across the United States. Those students find UI an excellent choice for a transformative experience <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/degree-finder?name=friday-letter&utm_source=031116&utm_medium=email&utm_content=degree_finder&utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" >(link)</a>  and a great value <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/uidaho/posts/10153931370605996"" >(link)</a>  from a national research university.<br> <br>Last fall, 30 percent of UI students joined us from across the nation, representing all 50 states. The Vandal impact has national reach. Why? Simply put, we offer out-of-state students something they cannot find in other places. That means outstanding degree programs, unique experiences and a connected Vandal family that is like no other. Students from outside Idaho give back to the university, too, contributing perspectives and life experiences that create a vibrant living and learning community.<br> <br>Our student body president, Max Cowan <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/student-involvement/asui/membership/executive"" >(link)</a> , originally hails from Portland, Oregon. He is in his second term as president of the Associated Students of the University of Idaho (ASUI). I’ve enjoyed working with Max president-to-president. I’ve seen him lead the executive branch of our student government with openness and integrity, valuing the input of others, designing smart policies and making tough decisions. Max is an environmental science and chemistry major. When he graduates this spring, he’ll have a bright future ahead of him, and he’ll leave behind a lasting legacy.<br> <br>We have many students from even farther afield, including Sarah Rose, a National Merit Scholar from the Chicago, Illinois, area. I met Sarah nearly two years ago during a visit Mary Beth and I made to the Taylor Wilderness Research Station. A double major in ecology and conservation biology and rangeland ecology and management, for her senior project Sarah designed and built a garden at Taylor that supplies fresh produce to visiting students and professors. As profiled in the latest issue of our College of Natural Resources magazine, Sarah found Taylor and our Semester in the Wild <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/cnr/semester-in-the-wild"" >(link)</a>  program a chance to dive deep into a unique interdisciplinary educational experience, learning more about herself in the process. We’re grateful for the contributions she’s made that will live long after she graduates and heads into an exciting future.<br> <br>Service, recreation, special programs — those are points of excellence that attract outstanding students like Max, Sarah and many others, and they are invaluable. But as a parent of students who have attended out-of-state institutions, I’m also sensitive to the price tag that accompanies that proposition. So I must point out that we are an option that many out-of-state students find affordable. Our net cost for non-Idaho students often compares very favorably to other states’ in-state net cost. That affordability helps our students graduate with less debt, positioning them for a stronger financial future <a href=""https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/school/?142285-University-of-Idaho"" >(link)</a> .<br> <br>We’re proud that so many students from across the U.S. join Idaho students in finding a place to flourish at UI. They’re discovering something we hope is no secret — that the University of Idaho is a unique institution. It is a place to explore new possibilities and to find the mentorship and hands-on experience that helps one forge a bright future. Just as it is a great place to be from, it is a great place to go … on your way to the rest of the world. 	<br> <img src=""../images/ab869efb-0378-42c0-8506-5f9b6dd580f2.jpg"" > 	<br>Go Vandals!<br><br>Chuck Staben<br>President 	<br>	<br> <img src=""../images/d329a9c8-6907-4172-8ec6-c529ed12ce69.jpg"" > 	<br><br>THE LATEST NEWS FROM UI <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news"" >(link)</a> <br><br>	<br><br>Alumni Support Helps Transform the UI Library<br><br>Julie Levine ’75 and her husband, David ’74, are helping enhance the student experience at the state’s largest library. “We are proud to support the University of Idaho Library because it is a center for scholarship and research,” Julie explained. “It benefits students, faculty, staff and visiting scholars.” Julie, a member of the library advisory board, and David, are donors to the library’s first floor remodel project <a href=""https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/about/firstfloor.html?name=friday-letter&utm_source=031116&utm_medium=email&utm_content=library&utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" >(link)</a> .

The programs are already part of the college’s Moscow-based curriculum and will be taught by the existing professors. “Launching these programs is tremendously exciting,” CLASS Dean Andrew Kersten said. “We are embarking on a new way to serve the citizens of Idaho.

Chopin also engages with the business and not-for-profit communities through several board memberships and by working with and mentoring entrepreneurs and start-up companies in Flagstaff and Phoenix. “We feel fortunate to have Marc Chopin join UI as our new dean of Business and Economics,” said John Wiencek, UI’s provost and executive vice president. “He is a proven scholar, educator and dean coming from a peer research institution.

It was a great thrill to join our university community in hosting the author, Boise’s own Anthony Doerr <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/class/general-education/common-read?name=friday-letter&utm_source=032516&utm_medium=email&utm_content=common-read&utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" >(link)</a> , to give a presentation about the book.<br> <br>Reading is an invaluable way to get information. I was told several years ago, “If you don’t have time to read, you don’t have time to lead.” If you’re not staying informed by reading widely, you might not be making the best possible decisions. So, aside from the inescapable world of email, what do I, as president, read?<br> <br>Each day, of course, I scan the local news: the Moscow-Pullman Daily News, The Lewiston Tribune, the Idaho Statesman, The Spokesman-Review and more. The Argonaut, our student media outlet, is part of my steady diet, and I check the Idaho Business Review for a state business perspective. Our family shares a subscription to The New York Times, but most often, my expert “clipping service” of Mary Beth and our children send me articles. Facebook friends <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/uidahopresident/"" >(link)</a>  also direct my attention to articles of interest, albeit at the cost of too much Facebook time.<br> <br>I am a higher education junkie, so the Chronicle of Higher Education, University Business Magazine and Inside Higher Education electronic briefings are daily rituals and great entrées to timely reports on higher education policy and innovation. Higher education books are on the list: “Designing the New American University,” by Arizona State University President Michael Crow; “The Innovative University,” by Clayton Christensen and Henry Eyring; and “Locus of Authority” by William Bowin and Eugene Tobin. Crow’s book, in particular, has influenced my thinking on the critical roles of public research universities in social mobility as well as in interdisciplinary research.<br> <br>I don’t set as much time aside as I should for recreational reading, and my Kindle Reader reflects some eclectic interests, running from detective fiction to history – everything from John Grisham and Janet Evanovich to books like “The Wright Brothers” by David McCullough. My occasional mention of the book “Warrior to Dreadnought” by David Brown has elicited some snarky comments about my tastes, but in my defense, 1865-1905 was a time of immense change in naval architecture, and the book highlights interesting engineering and change management issues. That’s reading, though – you nurture existing interests, cultivate new ones and share what you learn. <br> <br>Writing this letter may give you some insight into my interests as president. It certainly increases my resolve to expand my reading. We’ll be announcing our 2016-2017 Common Read soon, and while I can’t give it away, I assure you that it looks like a very compelling book that will give us a lot to think about. I look forward to coming together as a community to read it, share our understandings, and engage with ideas that matter through reading. <br><br>Have you read any good books lately?

This significant rise is one of the highest in the country and puts the college ahead of other law schools in Eastern Washington, Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota and South Dakota. The University of Idaho College of Law is the only ranked law school in the state. “While rankings can be one of many ways to evaluate the quality of a law school, this leap signifies how our reputation continues to grow in a positive direction,” said Mark L. Adams, dean of the College of Law. “Our faculty are experts in their fields yet they make themselves accessible to students. We provide an affordable and stellar education. And our career development center works diligently to help our students find jobs post-graduation.”  <br><br>Idaho WWAMI Partner Best Nationwide for Primary Care<br><br>Through the Idaho WWAMI program, the University of Idaho partners with the University of Washington’s School of Medicine to educate aspiring physicians from Idaho. The UW School of Medicine was ranked No. 1 in the nation <a href=""http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-medical-schools/primary-care-rankings?int=af3309&int=b3b50a&int=aac509"" >(link)</a>  for primary care education by in U.S. News & World Report’s 2017 Best Medical School rankings. The school was also ranked No. 1 for family medicine and No. 1 for rural medicine. The state of Idaho recently ranked 49th among states in per capita physicians; a shortage that is particularly felt in rural areas. Through the Idaho WWAMI program, Idaho students access UW resources and expertise, spending some time in Seattle but completing most of their curriculum in Idaho. A rural and underserved track positions students to serve in rural communities upon completion of their training. The program includes established residency opportunities — an in-demand component of medical education, especially in Idaho. The WWAMI program was established in 1972, and is expanding this year to include 40 seats for Idaho students. <br> <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/uidahopresident"" >(link)</a>  	<br>Facebook <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/uidahopresident"" >(link)</a>  	<br> <a href=""https://twitter.com/uidaho"" >(link)</a>  	<br>Twitter <a href=""https://twitter.com/uidaho"" >(link)</a>  	<br> <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/president"" >(link)</a>  	<br>Website <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/president"" >(link)</a>  	<br> <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/company/10313"" >(link)</a>  	<br>LinkedIn <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/company/10313"" >(link)</a>  	<br> <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/uidaho/"" >(link)</a>  	<br>Instagram <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/uidaho/"" >(link)</a>  	<br> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0QSeZacVEDvqBrO408BRkg"" >(link)</a>  	<br>YouTube <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0QSeZacVEDvqBrO408BRkg"" >(link)</a>  	<br>Click here to update your UI email subscription preferences. <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/email-preferences"" >(link)</a>  	<br>Office of the President | 875 Perimeter Drive MS 3151 | Moscow ID 83844-3151<br><br>Copyright © 2016 University of Idaho, All rights reserved.<br>You are receiving this email because of your affiliation with the University of Idaho.<br><br><br>         <br><br>	<br> "
2016-04-01,Why the Place Where You Attend College Matters,"April 1, 2016 	<br> <img src=""../images/78d0092c-6b67-41ab-8113-fb516677185b.jpg"" > 	<br>Dear Friends, 	<br>The place where you attend college matters. Sounds obvious, right? Just find the right school. But I want to concentrate on more expansive definitions of place and “matters.” Where you attend school is not just about the name of the institution on your sweatshirt, but about the community you discover, the setting for your growth as a person in these important years.<br> <br>Where you attend college is where you’ll grow as a person, work toward your professional future and forge lifelong friendships. Students won’t find any place quite like Moscow. This town is not just the backdrop to a university experience, it’s a special setting in which to learn and live. It’s a vibrant community, filled with opportunities for entertainment, recreation and culture; it’s also an unrivaled gateway to outdoor adventure <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/campus-recreation/outdoor-program/?name=friday-letter&utm_source=040116&utm_medium=email&utm_content=OutdoorProgram&utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" >(link)</a> . No surprise that Moscow has been named one of America’s top college towns. <a href=""https://livability.com/top-10/college/10-best-college-towns/2014/id/moscow"" >(link)</a> <br> <br>This weekend admitted students have a chance to experience that for themselves during our UIdaho Bound weekend <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/events/uidaho-bound/?name=friday-letter&utm_source=040116&utm_medium=email&utm_content=UIdahoBound&utm_campaign=friday-letter16%20at%20%E2%80%9CUIdaho%20Bound%20weekend.%E2%80%9D"" >(link)</a> . <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/events/uidaho-bound/?name=friday-letter&utm_source=040116&utm_medium=email&utm_content=UIdahoBound&utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" >(link)</a>  Tonight is “Moscow Friday,” a downtown celebration with music and food. Mary Beth and I will join our city and community leaders in welcoming students to the lively downtown. With new restaurants and businesses, and more on the way, it’s an exciting time for our town. I can’t wait to show that off to our prospective students, and hope as many Moscow people as possible come out and join the fun.<br> <br>On Saturday, UIdaho Bound participants get an extended opportunity to picture themselves as Vandals. They’ll take tours of our historic campus, where new facilities are coming to life. They’ll learn more about the hundreds of student activities and organizations on campus, see our residence halls and fraternity and sorority living options. Sessions on the logistics of college are critical, too, in everything from money management to registering for classes. We have late-night activities planned at our nationally recognized Student Recreation Center, as well.<br> <br>We’ve changed how we approach this weekend. Previously, we asked students to come up for “Moscow Thursday” and take their campus tours on a Friday. That schedule represents a significant difficulty for parents and guardians to take off work. We wanted to improve access and minimize time off, so we moved the events to Friday and Saturday. Many students and families are taking advantage of the change to join us this weekend, and we have another great UIdaho Bound weekend on April 22-23, for which admitted students can still register <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/events/uidaho-bound/register/"" >(link)</a> .<br> <br>I’m grateful to our faculty and staff, who are working to make Saturday a special day for prospective students. The close connections our students make with supportive staff and with faculty on the leading edge of their disciplines separates UI from other institutions. At UI, students aren’t just faces in the crowd — they’re engaged in hands-on learning opportunities with outstanding educators who are invested in student success.<br> <br>Weekends like this help students still deciding on a school really understand what we mean when we say that UI — and our town of Moscow — are big enough to matter, and small enough to care. 	<br> <img src=""../images/ab869efb-0378-42c0-8506-5f9b6dd580f2.jpg"" > 	<br>Go Vandals!<br><br>Chuck Staben<br>President 	<br>	<br> <img src=""../images/d329a9c8-6907-4172-8ec6-c529ed12ce69.jpg"" > 	<br><br>THE LATEST NEWS FROM UI <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news"" >(link)</a> <br><br>	<br><br>College of Law Advisory Council Honors Don Burnett<br><br>The College of Law Advisory Council recently created an endowed scholarship to honor Don Burnett, former dean of the College of Law, for his service to the college and the council.

Thirty students at Lapwai High School will attend a camp in summer 2017 at UI’s McCall Outdoor Science School, or MOSS. In the year following, a Lapwai teacher will lead a class where students further develop their science skills, study local problems that could be addressed with remote-sensing technology and work in collaboration with the tribe’s natural resources departments. Meanwhile, the research team will work collaboratively  with the community to develop research and evaluation questions to understand how using advanced technologies and addressing meaningful problems help the students not only learn principals of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), but also form a “STEM identity” connected to their cultural identity. <br><br>Clean Snowmobile Team Wins Awards at National Competition<br><br>For the second year in a row the University of Idaho engineering Clean Snowmobile Challenge (CSC) <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2016-march/032416-snowmobileteam/?name=friday-letter&utm_source=040116&utm_medium=email&utm_content=Snowmobile&utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" >(link)</a>  team returned from its annual competition at Michigan Tech University’s Keweenaw Research Center winner of the coveted Founder’s Trophy.The award recipient is selected by their peers for the most sportsmanlike conduct. In an event where teams have to be prepared for anything to go wrong, the UI team has built helping other teams into their engineering culture, even when their own sled is not performing optimally. The Vandal team also brought home awards for Most Likely to be Manufactured, Enovation E-Controls and the Most Innovative Emissions Design. In addition, UI’s “Voodoo” sled completed the 100-mile endurance run with the best overall gas mileage of 19.3 mpg, winning the team the Best Fuel Economy Award. More than 20 teams from the U.S., Canada and Finland competed in this year’s weeklong event.

2016-04-08,International Experiences at UI,"April 8, 2016 	<br> <img src=""../images/78d0092c-6b67-41ab-8113-fb516677185b.jpg"" > 	<br>Dear Friends, 	<br>You’ve heard me mention the “Friendship Families” program at the University of Idaho, something Mary Beth and I have gotten involved with over the past two years. We’ve come to know students from overseas who have chosen UI as the right place to pursue a transformative education. The Friendship Families program has helped us get to know talented individual students, but also learn more about the international experience at UI.<br> <br>One such student is Pavan Penkey, a master’s student in electrical engineering. Pavan is the president of the Indian Students' Association <a href=""http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/isa/?name=friday-letter&utm_source=040816&utm_medium=email&utm_content=ISA&utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" >(link)</a> , a group of students and faculty members interested in celebrating and sharing Indian culture. This month I hope the UI community joins me in attending their annual India Night celebration. With great food, music and attire, this is quite an experience, one that can be fun and enriching for all students and faculty and staff.<br> <br>India Night showcases a particular culture, but it is also a great example of the vibrancy that international students from 80 countries around the world bring to our campus and our community. They are drawn to UI by our reputation for excellence. Growing up and studying as an undergraduate in India, Pavan knew little about Idaho and less about UI, but a mentor knew of the excellence of Professor Brian Johnson in our College of Engineering, and recommended our institution. That’s the kind of word-of-mouth that we can be very proud of — the kind that travels over oceans and continents. We want to tell the world: This is a place where you can succeed, and where you can find a globally competitive academic experience.<br> <br>The reputation is well-earned. One of our distinguished guests at India Night this year is Dayaldas Meshri, a doctoral recipient in chemical engineering who went on to found a successful chemical research company. (I’ll just say that if you use a cellphone, you use this company’s products.) We’re fortunate to have alumni like Dr. Meshri stay involved at UI, and come back to share their experience and perspectives. They are proof of how a Vandal education makes our country and our world a better place.<br> <br>Our global connections offer a number of different programmatic opportunities. The Indian Student Association is one of many international student organizations that contribute to a rich campus culture. Our Confucius Institute <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/class/confucius-institute/?name=friday-letter&utm_source=040816&utm_medium=email&utm_content=ConfuciusInstitute&utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" >(link)</a>  is expanding cultural and language instruction across Idaho. Our Martin Institute <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/class/martin-institute/?name=friday-letter&utm_source=040816&utm_medium=email&utm_content=MartinInstitute&utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" >(link)</a>  offers programs on international themes and events like this week’s Borah Symposium, <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/class/borah/?name=friday-letter&utm_source=040816&utm_medium=email&utm_content=BorahSymposium&utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" >(link)</a>  as well as degree paths for students in interested in international work. (All three of the latter examples are housed in our College of Letters, Arts and Social Sciences.) UI students can travel and explore interests through Study Abroad programs organized by our International Programs Office <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/academics/ipo"" >(link)</a> .<br> <br>There are many doors that UI hold open to the world. These are programs of depth and caliber only found at Idaho’s leading, national research university. As we continue to find new areas of growth and build upon current success, our reputation will continue to grow here and abroad. 	<br> <img src=""../images/ab869efb-0378-42c0-8506-5f9b6dd580f2.jpg"" > 	<br>Go Vandals!<br><br>Chuck Staben<br>President 	<br>	<br> <img src=""../images/d329a9c8-6907-4172-8ec6-c529ed12ce69.jpg"" > 	<br><br>THE LATEST NEWS FROM UI <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news"" >(link)</a> <br><br>	<br><br>A Lifetime of Giving <br><br>Ken ’68 and Jane Reagan have been avid supporters of Vandal Athletics for more than 40 years.

2016-04-15,Our University’s Next 10 Years,"April 15, 2016 	<br> <img src=""../images/78d0092c-6b67-41ab-8113-fb516677185b.jpg"" > 	<br>Dear Friends, 	<br>“Make no little plans, they have no magic to stir men's blood."" – Daniel Burnham<br> <br>Several years ago, a friend of mine described the importance of sharing a vision when pursuing an important objective. His analogy was the stone breaker working in a quarry. If one views that job as breaking rocks, it's difficult to imagine being inspired or innovative about the day’s work. It’s hard to see how one would get up in the morning with enthusiasm to go break rocks. But if those rocks are headed for the Parthenon, you are no longer a stone breaker, but a temple builder, anxious to see how the next stone fits into a beautiful structure. This is the attitude that I believe each of us who loves the university must have, whether student, faculty or staff member, alumni or friend. And this is the attitude that can sustain us through difficulty and frustration.<br> <br>Yesterday we shared our Strategic Plan for 2016-2025 <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/provost/strategic-plan/?name=friday-letter&utm_source=041516&utm_medium=email&utm_content=StrategicPlan&utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" >(link)</a>  with the State Board of Education. This plan, thanks in large part to the energy and innovation of Provost and Executive Vice President John Wiencek, has been developed with unprecedented collaboration and input. The plan puts forth a shared vision of what the University of Idaho can become if we all work together, as well as metrics for us to measure success.<br> <br>This plan was not intended as a blueprint, but a conceptual sketch on which we can agree. A sketch in which everyone can see what we do, why we do it and how to contribute. Further detail will be developed at the college and division levels, and we have resolved to a yearly progress assessment and adaptation as the university evolves. But the key piece for our university to tackle its next 10 years with vision and intentionality is in place with this plan.<br> <br>The strategic plan calls for UI to innovate and engage, to transform and to cultivate. No one could call our goals little. For instance, we plan to become Idaho's only Carnegie Foundation “R1” university for “highest research activity,” joining the very top 100 universities nationwide. Our plan also calls for enrollment growth <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/admissions/?name=friday-letter&utm_source=041516&utm_medium=email&utm_content=Admissions&utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" >(link)</a>  to 17,000 students, while maintaining the outstanding experience for which UI is known. Enrollment growth is a key driver for resources needed to fuel institutional plan objectives, and it’s also important for meeting Idaho’s Complete College Idaho goals for 60 percent postsecondary attainment.<br> <br>Over the next nine years, I view our job as building one of the nation’s great public research universities. A university that excels in its broad, land-grant mission of transforming lives through education and scholarship. A university that leads Idaho in building a college-going culture <a href=""http://www.idahoednews.org/voices/changing-idahos-college-going-culture/#.ViFCOX6rRaQ"" >(link)</a>  that transforms the lives of individual students, assures the prosperity of families, and strengthens Idaho communities. A university that takes its place among top research universities <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/research?name=friday-letter&utm_source=041516&utm_medium=email&utm_content=Research&utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" >(link)</a> , not because we seek a particular label, but because we seek excellence and impact for our scholarship. A university that engages deeply with its constituents across the range of university activity. A “Beacon for Mountain and Plain.” <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/about"" >(link)</a> <br> <br>We are not stone breakers.

The tour included visits to the Integrated Research and Innovation Center, UI’s home for interdisciplinary research opening in spring 2017. The renovated College of Education was a stop, as board members viewed UI’s completely renovated facility for training the next generation of educators and movement science professionals. The group also visited the recently remodeled library. Board members also heard from student researchers about the UI undergraduate research program. At each stop, UI faculty and administration members explained the functions, need and value of each facility, along with bigger picture understandings of how UI prepares students for the future and how it uses research to address problems and discover new knowledge. “I’m grateful to the board members for taking the time to see the exciting developments on our campus,” said President Chuck Staben. “We’re proud to showcase the investments UI and the state are making in the excellence of Idaho’s leading, national research university.” <br><br>UI Receives Grant for Online Fire Protection Training<br><br>The University of Idaho, Idaho Falls received a $244,000 grant from the Idaho Department of Labor to fund an online fire protection certificate program <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2016-april/040816-firegrant/?name=friday-letter&utm_source=041516&utm_medium=email&utm_content=OnlineFireProtection&utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" >(link)</a>  starting this fall. Conducted by faculty and instructors in the College of Engineering’s existing Industrial Technology Program, the new courses will provide additional training for regional fire protection specialists and engineers, and the credits can be transferred into the UI fire ecology and management program. “There is currently a great need locally, in the state of Idaho, and nationally for fire protection specialists,” said Lee Ostrom, associate dean in the College of Engineering and director of academic programs at UI Idaho Falls. Accredited by the Association of Technology, Management, and Applied Engineering, the undergraduate program will consist of 18 credit hours, with six required three-credit classes, completed online in as little as three semesters. Topics include fire safety hazards analysis, fire suppression, community planning, fire protection and management, and structural designs for fire and life safety. Industry partners include Idaho Treatment Group, Battelle Energy Alliance, Walsh Engineering and CWI. <br><br>Students Selected for Kennedy Center National Theater Festival <br><br>Three students from the University of Idaho Theatre Arts Department were selected to participate in the National Kennedy Center American College Theatre Festival <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2016-april/040616-theaterstudents/?name=friday-letter&utm_source=041516&utm_medium=email&utm_content=KennedyCenter&utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" >(link)</a>  (KCACTF) in Washington, D.C., April 11-15. The trio and more than 55 other UI students represented the College of Letters, Arts and Social Sciences at the Region 7 festival in Denver in February.

We live and work in a complex economy that includes vibrant agricultural, natural resources, technology and health care sectors. UI leverages expertise and resources to create a stronger Idaho for students, for employees, and for businesses who want to succeed with innovation and excellence.<br> <br>Computer science is an area of strength at our university. We’re partnering with North Idaho College to allow students to transition from NIC to a four-year computer science degree <a href=""http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2016/mar/07/new-4-year-computer-science-degree-to-be-offered-i/"" >(link)</a>  at UI Coeur d’Alene. Cybersecurity, software development and computer engineering are critical in the technology sector and across industries. This program is an important investment being made by our legislature in the workforce needs of our state, and we will carry it out effectively. For North Idaho, this transfer option follows on the creation of the Cybersecurity Operations and Training Center in Post Falls <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/cda/uirp/ctoc/?name=friday-letter&utm_source=042216&utm_medium=email&utm_content=CTOC&utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" >(link)</a> . Funded with an Idaho Department of Labor grant, the new center will train up to 350 people, including those currently in the workforce, in the next few years. <br> <br>Our faculty at the College of Engineering’s Center for Secure and Dependable Systems, led by Jim Alves-Foss, can attest to cybersecurity’s importance. Alves-Foss and his teammate Jia Song, a research assistant professor <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/engr/news/features/jia-song?name=friday-letter&utm_source=042216&utm_medium=email&utm_content=cybersecurity&utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" >(link)</a> , are competing in the DARPA Grand Cyber Challenge, having already bested some of the top experts and institutions in the world on their way to the finals later this year, with a $2 million grand prize at stake. We are proud to lead with expertise in this field.<br> <br>In southeastern Idaho <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/idaho-falls"" >(link)</a> , we have historically worked closely with the Idaho National Laboratory to train their workforce. We train employees and others toward bachelor’s degrees in industrial technology, environmental science and advanced degrees in STEM fields. Cybersecurity is an important component of this work, too. We also partner with INL to conduct research in everything from nuclear engineering to geothermal energy – research that will fuel growth and opportunity.<br> <br>Lastly, I want to point out new work serving the agricultural teaching and research component of our land-grant mission for Idaho. Last week in Moscow, Idaho State Board of Education members heard a presentation about our Western Initiative for the Dairy Environment, <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/research/entities/cafe"" >(link)</a>  a developing initiative that will support dairy production and processing in Idaho. Our state is third in the nation in dairy production, and the industry represents 30 percent of our agricultural economy. We have an opportunity to support a critical industry, but also to ensure a stable and sustainable supply of protein for our world.<br> <br>We are a comprehensive university, and each of our academic and research functions engage directly and indirectly with the workforce and economic needs of our state. We will continue to look for opportunities to serve our state and the students who are our future employees, entrepreneurs and community leaders — in our farm fields, in our business offices and behind our computer screens.<br> <br>I invite you to watch the video below, from our 2016 Research Report, to see more of our research impact for Idaho and the world. 	<br> <img src=""../images/ab869efb-0378-42c0-8506-5f9b6dd580f2.jpg"" > 	<br>Go Vandals!<br><br>Chuck Staben<br>President 	<br> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slW2sJMKLNA"" >(link)</a> 	<br>Click the photo above to watch a video from UI's 2016 Research Report <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/research/news/research-reports/2016/?name=friday-letter&utm_source=042216&utm_medium=email&utm_content=ResearchReport&utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" >(link)</a> .<br>	<br> <img src=""../images/d329a9c8-6907-4172-8ec6-c529ed12ce69.jpg"" > 	<br><br>THE LATEST NEWS FROM UI <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news"" >(link)</a> <br><br>	<br><br>Celebrating 115 Years of CALS<br><br>Combining their commitment to the agriculture industry and appreciation of UI’s land-grant mission, the Food Producers of Idaho have offered a matching gift of $7,500 during the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences’ first-ever “Match Day” on April 26th. The goal to raise $15,000 in 36 hours will recognize Michael P. Parrella as the 15th dean in the 115 years of the college. “We are confident that Dean Parrella will provide excellent leadership for CALS, and we are excited to work with him for the benefit of Idaho’s agriculture industry,” said President Wyatt Prescott. “We challenge alumni, faculty, staff and students to join the Food Producers of Idaho in meeting the goal of the Dean’s Excellence Fund.” The Food Producers of Idaho is comprised of numerous commodity, farm and agribusiness organizations united to communicate, educate and advocate on behalf of the agriculture industry in Idaho.

Five teams of scholars and researchers from across colleges and disciplines have been awarded grants of between $40,000 and $80,000 through VIP, a competitive, university-wide grant program aimed at stimulating new research, creativity and scholarship. The VIP committee reviewed proposals with an eye for those that seemed most innovative, feasible and likely either to have a lasting impact within the university or to position UI to have an impact on a topic of regional or national relevance. President Chuck Staben made final decisions, based on committee recommendations. “We are excited and honored to invest in these projects that leap beyond the traditional boundaries of academia to create new knowledge, advance groundbreaking ideas and provide tangible benefits to our students, state and world,” Staben said. “These projects capture the spirit of creativity and innovation the University of Idaho seeks to foster.” <br><br>UI Theater Returns to Russia for Summer Study <br><br>University of Idaho faculty and 20 students within the College of Letters, Arts and Social Sciences will travel to Moscow, Russia <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2016-april/042016-moscow2moscow/?name=friday-letter&utm_source=042216&utm_medium=email&utm_content=TheaterRussia&utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" >(link)</a> , this summer to study at the world famous Moscow Art Theatre. During the visit, the group will see close to 20 performances, as well as tour famous museums and cultural sights in Moscow and the surrounding area. In addition to training and studying Russian theater and culture, UI assistant professor Matt Foss and students will perform a site-specific production of Tennessee Williams’ “The Glass Menagerie” at the Moscow Art Theatre. The performance is funded by the Vandal Theatre Lab, a grant-funded initiative helping to create student and outreach focused work. The Moscow Art Theatre was the home of world-famous actor and director Konstantin Stanislavsky, premiered and made famous many works of Anton Chekhov, and maintains a tradition of modern actor training.

UI Athletics Director Rob Spear and Head Football Coach Paul Petrino respect and will implement this decision.<br> <br>This is the right decision <a href=""https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/04/29/u-idahos-football-program-depart-football-bowl-subdivision?name=friday-letter&utm_source=050616&utm_medium=email&utm_content=Higher_Ed&utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" >(link)</a>  for our students, for academic excellence and long-term success and stature of the University of Idaho. We are, first and foremost, the state's leading residential and research university. The experience of our students and growing our capacity to educate and innovate must be the focal point for all of our actions.  <br> <br>I want to remind everyone what our choices, which we have evaluated over many months, were. We could: <br><br>1.	Remain in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of Division I as an independent after 2017, waiting for an invitation to join an FBS conference; or<br>2.	Join the Big Sky Conference, in the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) of Division I, gaining full membership in that conference.<br><br>The key factors in making this decision were whether UI could realistically expect to become a competitive FBS team that would be asked to affiliate with a stable FBS conference, versus the value of joining the Big Sky.<br> <br>UI has always been one of the lowest-resourced FBS football teams and has struggled to win. To become successful enough to affiliate with any FBS conference would entail unjustifiable, unsustainable expenditures with only a marginal chance of success. Enduring the significant challenges of competition as an independent weighed against an extremely uncertain future would be irresponsible when we have the alternative of joining one of the most stable FCS conferences that also allows us to renew traditional rivalries and offers our student-athletes the opportunity to excel at an appropriate level of competition, just as they do in our other Big Sky sports programs.<br> <br>We are very proud of this year’s Big Sky Conference championships <a href=""http://www.govandals.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=87267&SPID=10366&DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=17100&ATCLID=210797244"" >(link)</a> : women’s basketball, women’s soccer and women’s golf. Our men’s and women’s tennis teams and men’s golf team are playing for championship titles this weekend. Our overall athletic program, under Rob Spear’s leadership, has excelled and will continue to do so.<br> <br>We believe in the young men and the coaches on our Vandal football team. They have competed at a high level in the Sun Belt, and I know they will play well this coming fall and the next. Coach Petrino has done an outstanding job, and I am pleased that he is committed to staying with our program. But long-term, having no FBS conference affiliation option is problematic for recruitment, for rivalries that students and other fans get excited about, and poses little to no financial advantage. Continued instability will not help us build a program, and it holds back the university as a whole. Full membership in the Big Sky conference means we have a voice in all conference decisions and a seat at the table next to similar institutions in our geographic region. It is time to make this move.<br> <br>I understand some alumni and supporters do not agree that an FCS affiliation is our best option. Many passionate Vandals view our place in FBS as a mark of our institution’s “prestige” and “relevance.” The University of Idaho is our state’s land-grant university, the unquestioned statewide leader in higher education. Success on the football field should complement the prestige and relevance of our academic institution, but not define it. Rather, the impact of our institution will define us, as measured by the entire experience for our student body, including student-athletes; by academic excellence <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2015-november/110615-enrollmentnumbers/?name=friday-letter&utm_source=050616&utm_medium=email&utm_content=NationalMeritScholars&utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" >(link)</a>  across the university; by sustained research <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/research/?name=friday-letter&utm_source=0501616&utm_medium=email&utm_content=Research&utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" >(link)</a> , scholarly activity and creative success; and by deep engagement with communities and partnerships with industry.<br> <br>Over the past year, we have carefully considered our options, listening to alumni and other stakeholders, gathering input through face-to-face conversations, emails and letters, social media and more. We’ve conducted thorough due diligence through internal review and through a report conducted by an independent third-party analyst. We’ve estimated the costs and benefits of independence as they relate to positioning ourselves for the conference affiliation essential for our university to participate at any level of college football.  These estimates are both monetary and in terms of the total football experience for our university. Ultimately, that analysis suggests that the University of Idaho — our Athletics program, our student-athletes, our student body and fans, and our friends and supporters — are best served by a move to the Big Sky. We choose not to follow the faint hope of conference reorganizations, but to provide our athletes fair competition and the opportunity to succeed each time they step on the field.<br> <br>This decision is without precedent in the modern era of college football. I see that a leap into new waters alarms those who care deeply about our university. But the Big Sky Conference is hardly unknown; we have a long history of success in the conference. Big Sky football is exciting and nationally competitive, and our fans will enjoy seeing familiar uniforms from around the region: Montana, Montana State and others. We are fortunate to have this option available. It is a change, though, so let us promise that together we will build a top-tier program that competes for championships. We will create an outstanding student-athlete and community-wide experience around our program, a vibrant football culture that provides a great front porch for Idaho’s leading, national research university, a draw for future students and a continued source of pride for current students.<br> <br>I recognize this letter can’t answer all questions about this topic, and the move to the Big Sky entails many moving pieces, which we will address as they become clearer and as we have final plans. I also recognize the magnitude of this decision and the strong opinions that surround it, both for and against, but I am confident that joining the Big Sky Conference is the best possible course for our Athletics program and for our university. Of course, changes in the college athletics landscape may occur, and we will always seek the best opportunity for our students, student-athletes, and fans.<br> <br>The university’s impact is felt every day by our 100,000 Vandal alumni <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/alumni/?name=friday-letter&utm_source=0501616&utm_medium=email&utm_content=Alumni&utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" >(link)</a> . These women and men lead lives filled with meaning and opportunity. They exercise leadership in their communities and in their work. They are proud of their alma mater and give back so that others can have the same transformative experiences. I know some alumni will be disappointed by this decision. With the passionate support that separates the Vandal family from others, we are committed to a winning program in the Big Sky conference. I want all Vandals to experience success and pride, as part of a total University of Idaho experience that does right by its heritage, its land-grant mission and its future aspirations.

Just about anywhere on Earth — and in some cases, beyond. In April, we celebrated a “Month of Innovation” at UI, culminating with the College of Engineering Design EXPO <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/engr/events/expo%20/?name=friday-letter&utm_source=050616&utm_medium=email&utm_content=EngineeringEXPO&utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" >(link)</a>  last weekend. Each year at EXPO, we celebrate the capstone projects of our engineering students, invite high school students to campus, and connect with alumni and industry leaders who give their time as judges and advisors.<br> <br>This year, UI welcomed back Tom Mueller, <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2016-april/040416-spacex/?name=friday-letter&utm_source=050616&utm_medium=email&utm_content=EXPOKeynoteSpeaker&utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" >(link)</a>  a graduate of the College of Engineering and a co-founding employee of SpaceX. If you’ve watched the news recently, you’ve likely heard of SpaceX and seen their work in action. This company is pioneering reusable rockets, seeming to make a major advance with each rocket launch.<br> <br>Tom is from St. Maries, Idaho, in Benewah County, and the son of a logger. St. Maries is the gateway to the beautiful St. Joe River country, and a long way from SpaceX’s headquarters in Southern California. Yet, the University of Idaho was the launching pad for Tom’s career.<br> <br>During EXPO, about 500 visiting high school students experienced a weekend that showcases life and work at UI and in the College of Engineering. They visited locations around the Moscow campus, met with students and faculty, and engaged in hands-on activities.<br> <br>In addition to getting a taste of college life, these visiting students also got to see a UI engineering education in action, as more than 60 engineering seniors presented their capstone projects with booth presentations and technical presentations. Imagining, creating and refining a project is valuable, but so is the ability to communicate the importance of that work. The presentations are similar to TED talks, judged by industry and academic evaluators. Many evaluators were alumni who volunteered their time and insight and we appreciate their particular expertise and encouragement to our students.<br> <br>Other Month of Innovation <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2016-march/033116-monthofinnovation/?name=friday-letter&utm_source=050616&utm_medium=email&utm_content=MonthOfInnovation&utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" >(link)</a>  programs, events and initiatives included a student-organized TEDx event; an Undergraduate Research Symposium; the UI’s first Three-Minute Thesis competition and the Innovation Showcase through our College of Graduate Studies. The College of Business and Economics hosted Idaho Pitch and business plan contests, during which more than $30,000 was awarded to student-conceived business enterprises.<br> <br>The entire month served to highlight that at UI, our students encounter new ideas and are encouraged to find fresh approaches across disciplines, and to have opportunities to refine those ideas through presentation and competition.<br> <br>These experiences are critical elements of a transformative education. They help current students — and our future students — get a better picture of the possibilities and opportunities that come with a college education: the great heights a world-class education can propel them to. They, like Tom Mueller, can reach for the stars. 	<br> <img src=""../images/ab869efb-0378-42c0-8506-5f9b6dd580f2.jpg"" > 	<br>Go Vandals!<br><br>Chuck Staben<br>President 	<br>	<br> <img src=""../images/d329a9c8-6907-4172-8ec6-c529ed12ce69.jpg"" > 	<br><br>THE LATEST NEWS FROM UI <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news"" >(link)</a> <br><br>	<br><br>TRIO-INSPIREs the Future for Idaho’s Students<br><br>Growing up in a rural southern Idaho county where only 26.5 percent of residents hold at least an associate degree, the odds were against Robin Miller making it to college.

Parents who own property are paying the taxes to support those schools, so why pay out-of-state tuition somewhere else? Often, the state universities have excellent job placement records, and isn’t that the reason students attend? … My college experience gave me freedom and opportunities that changed my life as I focused on one main goal: work at a rewarding job, support myself and use my talents to live the best life possible.

This spring Alyssa Ertel, a third-year honors program student from Kennewick, Washington, earned a prestigious Goldwater Scholarship <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2016-april/040416-goldwaters/?name=friday-letter&utm_source=052016&utm_medium=email&utm_content=Goldwater&utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" >(link)</a> . That award supports careers in science, mathematics and engineering. Alyssa, a student of chemical engineering and chemistry, is one of only 252 new Goldwater scholars nationwide this year. UI has had 11 students earn this award over the past decade.<br> <br>UI also had numerous recipients this year of the Benjamin A. Gilman Scholarship, a competitive scholarship given to only 2,700 recipients nationwide. Sponsored by the U.S. State Department, the scholarship supports international study and internship opportunities. In the fall, sophomores Emily and Jordan Kizer used their scholarships to live and learn in Peru. Samuel Hermann, a senior international studies major from Genesee, Idaho, participated in a research project in Senegal. This spring junior Clarisa Lopez, a clothing, textile and design major, went to France. Joshua Warnick from Coeur d’Alene, Idaho, went to Morocco. We’ll have two more Gilman scholars this summer: William Juarez-Tapia, from Filer, Idaho, is going to China, and Lauren Hirsch from Fair Oaks, California, is bound for Russia. I’m excited about the academic and cultural opportunities they’ll experience, and the perspectives they’ll be able to share with their classmates when they return to UI.<br> <br>We also applaud the work of Katey Huggler, a senior in wildlife resources from Priest River, Idaho, who earned a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship, a great step toward future study and an exciting career.

Approximately 500 students, in all colleges and undergraduate majors, participate in the program. There are many opportunities for mentorship, peer support and involvement in everything from undergraduate research to volunteerism. The program is an invaluable part of the academic life of our research university.<br> <br>These honors show the high caliber of students we have here at UI. We once again led the Northwest in the number of National Merit Scholars <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/financial-aid/scholarships/nationalmeritscholarship/"" >(link)</a>  who chose UI as freshmen, with 23 of Idaho’s 24 scholars. These students are in the top 1 percent of high school students and pass a rigorous course of tests to become National Merit finalists. In addition, we’ll be joined next fall by a new Gates Millennium Scholar, Enrique Gutierrez from Parma, Idaho. It is a point of pride that these talented students choose the University of Idaho to prepare them for life and work. They enhance the academic vitality of UI for all students on their way to further distinction in the paths they take as Vandals.<br> <br>We also have many students who are accomplishing great things in other ways. That includes the many students who volunteer in their communities and through programs like our Alternative Service Breaks. It includes those who take leadership roles in student government and in fraternity and sorority life. It includes those who excel in scholarship and creative work. And it certainly includes the many students who have overcome challenges of all kinds and found their way forward through higher education at the state’s leading, national research university. I congratulate our students on their success, and wish them well in their future as graduates and as citizens.  	<br> <img src=""../images/ab869efb-0378-42c0-8506-5f9b6dd580f2.jpg"" > 	<br>Go Vandals!<br><br>Chuck Staben<br>President 	<br>	<br> <img src=""../images/d329a9c8-6907-4172-8ec6-c529ed12ce69.jpg"" > 	<br><br>THE LATEST NEWS FROM UI <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news"" >(link)</a> <br><br>	<br><br>Late Alumna, UI Extension Professional Honored<br><br>Lydia Clayton ’04, ’09 committed her life to producing food sustainably and educating others.

2016-08-19,Why UI is the Best Choice,"<p></p> 
<p>This morning, a brand new class of Vandals comes together at <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/events/university-convocation/?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=081916&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=Convocation&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" target=""_blank"">Convocation</a>, the annual tradition marking the beginning of our academic year and the start of each student’s educational journey. It can be a time filled with trepidation for students — and for parents. Yesterday I had the opportunity to meet students and parents moving into our residence halls. I saw young women and men wondering what college is all about. I also saw students excited to embark on an adventure, ready to take charge of their futures with a college degree.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> There is no better way to take charge of your future than to join the Vandal family.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Recently, Money magazine named the University of Idaho the <a  href=""http://time.com/money/4398295/best-college-in-every-state/?xid=time_socialflow_twitter%20"" target=""_blank"">“</a><a  href=""http://time.com/money/4398295/best-college-in-every-state/?xid=time_socialflow_twitter%20"" target=""_blank"">Best College” in our state</a><a  href=""http://time.com/money/4398295/best-college-in-every-state/?xid=time_socialflow_twitter%20"" target=""_blank"">,</a> based on our winning combination of affordability, academic excellence and outcomes after college. The publication notes our <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/degree-finder/?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=081916&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=DegreeFinder&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" target=""_blank"">broad range of academic offerings</a>, in everything from agricultural research to natural resources to music and the arts. Money joins the <a  href=""https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/school/?142285-University-of-Idaho"" target=""_blank"">College Scorecard</a> in highlighting our success for students: outstanding educational opportunities, robust financial aid and graduate earnings that are the highest of any institution in Idaho.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> I’m highlighting post-graduation outcomes — that might seem like a long way down the road for our Convocation attendees. But career success is top of mind for many, as increasingly students are focused on college as a way to get a well-paying job. That’s a smart outlook, as studies show a college degree is the key to earning &nbsp;$1 million more over a lifetime than those with only a high school degree. Some <a  href=""https://cew.georgetown.edu/cew-reports/americas-divided-recovery/%20"" target=""_blank"">95 percent of all new jobs</a> created since the Great Recession have gone to those with at least some college experience. University of Idaho <a  href=""https://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report%20"" target=""_blank"">graduates lead the way</a> among our state’s institutions when it comes to mid-career salaries — it’s not even close. That financial stability underpins a great life for UI grads.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> On their way to graduation, though, I hope students will treasure the unique experiences they have to grow as thinkers, as leaders, and as members of a caring community. Many Vandals have the chance to participate in <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/research/students/undergraduate-research/?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=081916&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=UndergraduateResearch&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter1"" target=""_blank"">hands-on research</a>. They learn and receive mentorship from the best and brightest faculty members. They have unparalleled access to <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/campus-recreation/outdoor-program/?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=081916&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=Outdoor%20Program&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16%20"" target=""_blank"">outdoor adventure</a>. In <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/student-involvement/?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=081916&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=GreekLife&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" target=""_blank"">our student organizations</a>, in <a  href=""http://www.govandals.com//"" target=""_blank"">Athletics</a>, and in our <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/student-life/greek/?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=081916&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=GreekLife&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" target=""_blank"">sorority and fraternity systems</a>, they find support networks and form lasting friendships. As I’ll tell our students this morning: A lot happens here on the way to the rest of your life. Take advantage of every minute of it.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> We’re proud to be joined at our Convocation by Hattie Kauffman, an award-winning journalist who will share her inspirational story. Ms. Kauffman, a member of the Nez Perce Tribe, was born in Idaho and has deep roots in the area. She is a trailblazing journalist and author, and a great example of the success one can have through higher education. I’m grateful that Ms. Kauffman could be with us in Moscow today, and I hope the newest members of our Vandal family gain a&nbsp;better idea of what is possible in college and in life — as a student, as a graduate and as a person.<br /> <br /> Go Vandals!<br /> <br /> Chuck Staben<br /> President<br /> <br /> </p>

2016-08-26,Kicking Off Our Vandal Football Season,"<p></p> 
<p>On Thursday, Sept. 1, <a  href=""https://tkt.xosn.com/tickets/TicketHome.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=17100"" target=""_blank"">our Vandal football season</a> kicks off at the Kibbie Dome. I've often referred to our Athletics program as the “front porch” of the university — the place where we come together to celebrate our heritage, our current work and our bright future. I’m confident we’ll also get to see a great game as the Montana State Bobcats come to town.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> A lot has happened since our last football game. I made the difficult decision to affiliate our program with the Big Sky Conference after the 2017 season. One exciting factor in the conference change was the opportunity for regional rivalries. As a current Big Sky team, our neighboring land-grant, research institution across the mountains in Bozeman provides an example of the regional match-ups that we hope will create enthusiasm among our fans and make the University of Idaho's story more visible.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Our student-athletes are ambassadors for that story of excellence. As the father of two NCAA athletes myself, I have seen the dedication and commitment it takes to be successful. Juggling academics and athletics is not an easy proposition, especially at the Division I level, but our Vandal athletes work hard to maintain excellence on and off the field. Last year, 24 football players made either the Academic Honor Roll or the Commissioner’s List for their conference. Across other sports in fall and winter, 55 student-athletes earned Big Sky Conference All-Academic honors, with more to come when the spring results are tallied.&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;<br /> For student-athletes, that hard work pays off. They are <a  href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/forget-just-being-well-rounded-have-depth-breadth-jeff-selingo"" target=""_blank"">highly valued by employers</a> for their work ethic, ability to focus and commitment to task completion. Our Vandals who don’t go pro in their sports — plenty do, I should point out — join the rest of the Vandal family in contributing as leaders and innovators in industries and organizations across the nation and the world.&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Our faculty and staff contribute to that success. In appreciation for that service, my office has collaborated with the Athletics Ticket Office to offer <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/faculty-staff-news/2016-august/082316-freefootballtix/?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=082616&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=FootballTickets&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" target=""_blank"">two free tickets to the Sept. 1 game</a> for our Vandal employees. Additional tickets can be purchased for just $5. Thank you to all UI employees for contributing to the excellence of the University of Idaho.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> I hope to see as many Vandals as possible in the <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/events/idaho-fan-zone"" target=""_blank"">Idaho Fan Zone</a>, coming together to root on our student-athletes. We will set up on the SprinTurf just east of the dome with live music, great food and plenty of activities for kids. The <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/class/music/ensembles/marching-band/?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=082616&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=VandalMarchingBand&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" target=""_blank"">Vandal Marching Band</a> will offer its customarily rousing, occasionally irreverent routine to get us energized. Admission to the Fan Zone is free — just come ready to have fun and cheer on our team as it heads into the season, representing the best of the Vandal spirit.</p>

2016-09-02,Important Changes for College-Bound Students,"<p></p> 
<p>The University of Idaho remains committed to bringing more students — especially Idaho students — into the life-changing, career-shaping experience of higher education. That has been a central goal of my presidency. This fall we are rolling out ways to make getting to college easier and paying for college more affordable.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> First: <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/admissions/first-year/admission-requirements/"" target=""_blank"">We are eliminating the application fee for Idaho residents</a>. This $60 charge typically accompanies completion of the necessary paperwork to claim one’s spot at the university. But I want to continue streamlining the application process to ensure Idaho students have access to the best university in our state. While $60 may be a small hurdle, it is a hurdle nonetheless. We don’t want students to trip up on those critical first steps toward a college degree, a rewarding career and a great life.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Second, we are excited about the state’s Direct Admit program, offering high school students automatic admission to Idaho’s public colleges and universities, based on their academic qualifications. Students should expect a letter soon from the state informing them of their choices and <a  href=""https://nextsteps.idaho.gov/%20"" target=""_blank"">next steps</a>. The University of Idaho will follow up with those students, offering guidance on how to complete the process and get started with a Vandal education.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Those steps are about getting to college. What about paying for college? An important change students and parents should be aware of is the ability to take advantage of the <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/financial-aid/apply-for-aid/dates-and-deadlines/?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=090216&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=FinancialAid&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" target=""_blank"">new Oct. 1 FAFSA date</a>. This has important ramifications for financial aid. Instead of waiting until next spring’s tax filing deadline, families can now complete the 2017-18 FAFSA starting October 1, using their previous year’s (2015) income information. (You may see this change referred to as “early FAFSA” or “prior-prior year” reporting.) Families will have more clarity, sooner, about what to expect in financial support.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Our university is moving its <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/financial-aid/apply-for-aid/dates-and-deadlines/?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=090216&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=FinancialAid&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" target=""_blank"">priority date for financial aid</a> up from February 15 to December 1. Students who have completed the application process (and Idaho students who have completed the Direct Admit process) will begin to receive notice of their financial awards as soon as mid-December. While students can still qualify for scholarships and financial aid after December 1, we want as many families as possible to be aware of their financial aid packages before the holiday season.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Each student and family should have as much information as possible, and as much time as possible to digest it, to make a good choice about college.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The University of Idaho is our state’s leader in educational quality and in college affordability: <a  href=""https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/school/?142285-University-of-Idaho%20"" target=""_blank"">value that makes UI a great choice</a>. UI awarded <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2016-july/071116-scholarships/?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=090216&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=Scholarships&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" target=""_blank"">$25 million in scholarships</a>&nbsp;this fall, more than any other public institution in the state. More than $8 million of that support came from gifts and endowments thanks to the contributions of Vandal alumni and friends. Scholarship support helped families across the income spectrum make college a reality – for instance,&nbsp;we helped more than 4,000 Idaho students with family incomes averaging $41,000 afford tuition and fees, room and board, and books.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The best ambassador for the value of a Vandal education is the success of our graduates. Getting in to college and making it affordable can be daunting, but we know that it pays off for students and is essential in today’s world. Vandal alumni, please help us spread the word about these exciting changes and the value of your experience at UI.<br /> <br /> Go Vandals!<br /> Chuck Staben</p>

2016-09-09,Meet Our New Research Leader,"<p></p> 
<p class=""p1"">Janet Nelson joined us this month as our new vice president for research and economic development. She was most recently the associate vice chancellor for research development at the University of Tennessee and has more than 30 years of experience in scientific research and administration.</p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>Over the next few weeks&nbsp;she will be touring Idaho to visit&nbsp;agencies, industry partners and UI locations. I interviewed Janet this week to capture firsthand her thoughts on the <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/research/?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=090916&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=Research&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"">role of research</a>, on the importance of expert teams, and on moving to Idaho and returning to her roots in the West.</span></p> 
<p class=""p2""><strong><span>Why did you want to work at the University of Idaho?</span></strong></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>Every time I visited the University of Idaho, I became more impressed with the opportunities at the university, the beauty of the region and the warmth of the people. I was actually born in Bozeman, Montana, and I spent many summers at my grandfather’s ranch in Dillon. It is fun to be out West again. The opportunity to join the senior leadership in place here was also a key part of my decision.</span></p> 
<p class=""p2""><strong><span>How has your experience in science and research administration prepared you for this role?</span></strong></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>Like the University of Tennessee, Idaho is a land-grant university and a flagship university. The research and development aspects of this position will be quite similar to what I’ve been doing the past few years at UT. For example, to grow the NIH portfolio, I worked with the faculty to strategically go after NIH funding. I also have extensive history at DOE national labs, from my postdoctoral training at Los Alamos National Laboratory, to five years at the National Energy Technology Laboratory, to fostering partnerships between UT and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. I really enjoy building relationships and helping the academic, government and industry continuum leverage their different research strengths to attack a problem in a common way.</span></p> 
<p class=""p1""><strong><span>One of UI’s goals, as spelled out in our new Strategic Plan, is to become a Carnegie R1 “Highest Research Activity” institution. What will that take?</span></strong></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>I’m very excited about the university’s new <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/provost/strategic-plan/?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=090916&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=StrategicPlan&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"">strategic plan</a>. It’s very aggressive, but I think it’s achievable. We’re going to have to roll up our sleeves, but a lot of the resources are currently in place. However, we will need improvement in infrastructure, in laboratory space and in cluster hires in areas of expertise. We’re going to have to work at growing different sources of research funding, and not just relying on federal expenditures. One thing to be careful about is that we can’t be the best at everything. We’re going to have to be selective about where we focus.</span></p> 
<p class=""p2""><strong><span>Why should the general public care about research? What does it mean for an Idahoan?</span></strong></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>Research is key to the mission of a land-grant university. I see a tight integration between education, research and economic development. I think research comes down to understanding how things work and then applying that knowledge to address a common problem. People in Idaho, just like people in the rest of the nation and the rest of the world, all have common problems, whether it’s health disparities, energy shortages or food issues. So the <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/research/news/research-reports/2016/?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=090916&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=ResearchReport&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"">research we do at universities</a>, and the work we can take to the next level and commercialize, is important in helping solve and address these challenges.</span></p> 
<p class=""p2""><strong><span></span></strong></p> 
<strong> </strong> 
<p class=""p1""><strong>Your description of research seems to go beyond the laboratory. Do you have a broad definition of research?</strong></p> 
<p><strong></strong></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>Yes. I embrace all research, scholarship and creative activity, and I’m going to make a point to address that intensely. I’m a chemist by training, but I’m very proud of having a BA from a liberal arts college. We have to understand that the standards for excellence for each&nbsp;discipline is different. For instance, a <a  href=""http://www.gf.org/about/fellowship/"" target=""_blank"">Guggenheim fellowship</a> is as prestigious as an <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/research/news/featured-research/2016/nsf-career-awards/?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=090916&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=NSFCareerAwards&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"">NSF CAREER Award</a>. Part of my responsibility is to celebrate excellence in each of the fields and help all the fields progress.</span></p> 
<p class=""p2""><strong><span>What themes do you see emerging in research?</span></strong></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>One of the things that I’m really passionate about with research is the emerging national theme of multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research. We have a great opportunity at UI to embrace this approach to tackle problems that one discipline alone can’t solve. For example, the food, water, energy nexus is going to bring together many disciplines and require a team effort. I really like team building, and it is important to understand that an expert team is not the same as a team of experts. I want to help build expert teams to help solve important problems.</span></p> 
<p class=""p2""><strong><span>You brought your family here. How are they feeling about this move?</span></strong></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>I have a grown daughter in North Carolina, but I brought my husband and my young daughter here, and they are very excited about the move and we are all enjoying Moscow and the region.</span></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>Thank you, Janet, for your time, and welcome again to our national research university.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> Go Vandals!<br /> <br /> Chuck Staben<br /> President</span><br /> <br /> </p>

2016-09-16,The Best Campus is a Safe Campus,"<p></p> 
<p>The University of Idaho has always stood out for having a distinctive residential campus. Among our historic buildings and modern facilities, students find a living and learning environment that facilitates growth and success. To reach that potential, a safe, supportive environment is paramount. Safety is a consideration at all our locations across the state, but with the majority of our students coming to live in Moscow, the residential campus requires a particular focus.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> In the upcoming week, we affirm our values as a caring community and renew our commitment to look out for our new and continuing students. This Sunday, UI's&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/events/safety-week"" target=""_blank"">Safety Week</a> and Hazing Prevention Week begins, connecting students with tools and resources, expert advice and best practices, and an understanding of the support offered by UI faculty and staff, as well as fellow students. For the fourth consecutive year, new full-time students will complete our <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/orientation/think-about-it/?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=091616&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=ThinkAboutIt&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" target=""_blank"">“Think About It”</a> course, a mandatory orientation seminar that provides an interactive examination of relationships, substance abuse and violence. Two additional events — the Katy Benoit Safety Forum and a keynote address on hazing — are just a couple of examples of the opportunities to come together and focus on critical safety issues. I encourage our students to take advantage of these learning experiences.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Our participation in the national <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/student-affairs/dean-of-students/violence-prevention/green-dot/?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=091616&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=GreenDot&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" target=""_blank"">Green Dot</a> program offers techniques and training for realistic bystander intervention in situations with potential for interpersonal violence. On Sunday, UI is <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2016-september/091216-safetyweek/?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=091616&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=GreenDot&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" target=""_blank"">joining 50 other institutions nationwide</a> in a simultaneous Green Dot training. I want to also highlight the annual <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/diversity/dhr/womens-center/events/take-back-the-night/?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=091616&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=TakeBackTheNight&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" target=""_blank"">Take Back the Night</a> rally, hosted by the Women’s Center. Mary Beth will participate in that event and is looking forward to sharing her experiences as a physician and discussing solutions with UI students and staff – women and men alike. Safety Week events key in on the <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/vandal-health-education/i-got-your-back/?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=091616&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=IGotYourBack&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" target=""_blank"">“I Got Your Back”</a> concept and affirm that we Vandals support and take care of each other.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> A safe campus also requires a modern and dependable infrastructure. Last year, we made an investment in new cameras across our public spaces and at the entrances to some of our shared spaces. These cameras complement our existing security, and are investments in deterrence and accountability for our entire campus community.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The practices, perspectives and emphasis on resources and support goes beyond Safety Week. This is a commitment we must live out every day, continually assessing and improving our efforts. I can speak from personal experience as a parent, having delivered two sons and a daughter to college, that safety is a weighty consideration. As a president, that perspective keeps me focused on making sure all our students have an outstanding educational experience, and that the best residential campus in Idaho is also the safest residential campus in Idaho.</p>

2016-09-23,Sneak Peek at New Book of UI History,"<p></p> 
<p>There is no place quite like the University of Idaho. We have a special story to tell as an outstanding institution with a proud history and a bright future. A new book, &quot;University of Idaho: The Campus History Series,&quot; by Erin Passehl-Stoddart, head of Special Collections and Archives at the UI Library, and Katherine G. Aiken, a history professor in the College of Letters, Arts and Social Sciences, offers a photographic exploration of our institution’s history and current life. Vandals familiar with histories like “A Beacon for Mountain and Plain” by Rafe Gibbs or “This Crested Hill” by Keith Petersen will find this new effort a worthy companion.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The photos showcased span the 127 years of Idaho’s leading national research university. You’ll view a journey across the rich student life, research and scholarship, academic excellence, and Athletics success at UI. You’ll recognize the people and the places that are an indelible part of who we are. You’ll discover anew the story of a university with modest beginnings on its way to great things.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> I was honored to write a foreword for “University of Idaho: The Campus History Series.” Let me reiterate here my appreciation for the history and mission of this institution, so thoughtfully highlighted in the curation and writing of this book. And again I extend my gratitude to Erin Passehl-Stoddart and Katherine Aiken for a fine work that is a great addition to the story of our university.<br /> <br /> Below are a just a handful of images from the book. <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/president/communications/friday-letter/campus-history-series+/"" target=""_blank"">Visit this site</a> for an even larger sample, and head to the <a  href=""https://www.lib.uidaho.edu//special-collections/arcadia.html"">UI Library’s Special Collections</a> for more background and ordering information.

2016-09-30,Three Stories of Vandal Spirit and Success,"<p></p> 
<p class=""p1"">At our 108th Homecoming this weekend, our <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/events/signature-events/homecoming?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=093016&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=Homecoming&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"">“Joe for the Gold”</a> theme nods at this summer’s Olympics and UI’s excellence in preparing graduates for success. It has been a fun week filled with spirit competitions, our 67th annual blood drive, the annual Serpertine tonight and more. I’m looking forward to joining Vandals from near and far tomorrow at the parade and football game.</p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>As I have worked at UI, I have been struck by the passion of our alumni. In particular, for many alumni, the Vandal spirit is handed down through generations — a family tradition of an outstanding academic experience that leads to great careers and great lives. I want to highlight three stories that exemplify that multi-generational Vandal success story.</span></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>Being a University of Idaho Vandal is a point of pride for Lieutenant Governor Brad Little and his wife, Teresa Soulen Little. The Littles are both native Idahoans and second-generation Vandals who followed in their parents’ footsteps to attend UI. Brad earned his degree in agribusiness, then put that degree to work helping to run his family ranch in Emmett. He and Teresa are proud that their two sons carried on the family tradition and also became Vandals. The Littles have served on several UI boards and participate in UI activities; in fact, it isn’t unusual to see the family together in Moscow cheering on the Vandal football team. Brad will be back in Moscow — his “home-away-from-home” — to participate in this weekend’s Homecoming activities, including the parade through downtown. The Littles are hoping to see their five grandchildren one day make their way down Hello Walk on their own journey toward a UI diploma.</span></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>Patty and Mike Fery, from Boise, are also multi-generational Vandals who care about giving back to UI. Patty, a communications graduate, has worked in marketing for high-profile Idaho companies. A dedicated Vandal volunteer, she helped reinvigorate our Parent and Family Association, offering <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/student-affairs/parents?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=093016&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=Parents&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"">information, resources and support</a> for Vandal families. Her mother and father were UI graduates, in accounting and architecture, respectively. Mike serves on the Foundation board, and their children are following their example as Vandals, with one joining the ranks of our alumni and another soon to follow. Having had the good fortune to get know the Ferys, I especially admire Patty’s strong interest in helping students with learning disabilities succeed in school, and am glad we share that interest in helping all students flourish.<br /> <br /> One more multi-generational success story, appropriate for this weekend. Flip Kleffner was our director of <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/alumni?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=093016&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=AlumniOffice&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"">Alumni Relations</a> for 15 years; he and his wife, Jo, were named “Idaho Treasures” in 2007. Vandal football fans recall that Flip, an Athletics Hall of Fame member, kicked an 82-yard punt against Washington State University in 1953. The Kleffners have generously supported the College of Education building renovation. They have also seen their five children and six grandchildren attend UI. I’ve met the Kleffners and am proud of their friendship and grateful for their continued support of UI.</span></p> We have many 
<p> Vandals, of course, who are the first generation in their family to attend UI, or to attend any institution. A UI degree positions graduates for long-term success, so I welcome all our new Vandals to start a family tradition of their own. For Vandals old and new, this will always be a place to come home to.</p> 
<span> Go Vandals!<br /> <br /> Chuck Staben<br /> President<br /> <br /> P.S.: Are you a multi-generation Vandal family? Share your story with us, we’d love to hear it. We may post it at my Facebook page, <a  href=""https://www.facebook.com/uidahopresident"" target=""_blank"">www.facebook.com/uidahopresident</a>. Go Vandals and happy Homecoming!</span>

2016-10-07,Big Goals from Our State of the University,"<p>This week I delivered my third <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/president/communications/presentations?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=100716&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=StateOfTheUniversity&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" target=""_blank"">State of the University address</a> as a Vandal. I shared with our faculty and staff, along with our supporters and friends, the success we’ve had in the past year.&nbsp; I also shared the goals and initiatives of our <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/provost/strategic-plan?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=100716&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=StrategicPlan&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" target=""_blank"">Strategic Plan</a>, the basis of an exciting future for our students and our state.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> We set ambitious goals for innovation at UI – the research, scholarly activity and creative work that makes an impact in Idaho and beyond. As a broad institutional goal, we have our sights set on R1 “Highest Research Activity” status by 2025, a standard for comparing institutions published by the Carnegie Classification. UI is already Idaho’s only R2 “higher research activity” university. Joining the research elite by becoming R1 is an exciting prospect, but really just an indicator for enhanced impact. Initiatives like our Rock Creek Ranch partnership and our dairy/cattle initiative present interesting research opportunities and meet needs for Idaho. We are on our way – this year, for the first time ever, we have crossed $100 million in research expenditures.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> We’re also going to deepen our engagement within Idaho. The <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/media-coverage/012216-idahoednews?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=100716&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=DirectAdmit&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" target=""_blank"">Direct Admit program</a> that offers automatic admission for qualified seniors will continue to make strides in changing our college-going culture. We’re going to renew our “Vandal Ideas Project,” an internal investment in UI creativity. Last year our focus was interdisciplinary scholarship and research. This year, the Vandal Ideas Project will tackle the “Engage” goal, working to help Idaho’s “go-on” effort. As the statewide higher education leader, we are well-positioned to apply our strengths to improve the Idaho we are proud to call home. &nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;<br /> We want to continue to transform lives at UI. That means increasing our enrollment, improving our retention, and ensuring our curricula evolve to best prepare our students for the dynamic and fast-changing world after graduation. We are making strides, with encouraging enrollment projections for our <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/admissions/apply"" target=""_blank"">incoming freshmen</a> and <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/admissions/transfer"" target=""_blank"">transfer students</a>, for underrepresented groups, and for residents of Idaho. Our Idaho resident enrollment has increased 7 percent this year; underrepresented groups by 14 percent. Progress will be gradual as we build on successive classes in the years ahead, but it has started.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> We also want to cultivate a valued and diverse community for students and for faculty and staff. We have some work to do in making our organization the best it can be for our employees. But we are tackling that issue head-on, and we will see progress. I want our institution to have a growth mindset, and as we turn the corner on enrollment, as we continue our excellence in research, teaching, and statewide engagement, we’ll connect better with our institutional excellence. We have the capability to solve any problem when we work together.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Last, this is an exciting time on campus. New facilities are expanding our capacity and capabilities. We’ve ushered in the new <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/here-we-have-idaho-magazine/education"" target=""_blank"">College of Education</a> building, a <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/here-we-have-idaho-magazine/library"" target=""_blank"">revamped Library</a>, and will open the <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/here-we-have-idaho-magazine/iric"" target=""_blank"">Integrated Research and Innovation Center</a> soon. We have plans for a renovated home for our <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/academics/wwami?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=100716&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=WWAMI&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" target=""_blank"">WWAMI program</a>, which has grown to meet Idaho’s medical education needs. A <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/giving/athletics/idaho-arena/arena-story?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=100716&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=Arena&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" target=""_blank"">new court sports arena</a> is on the horizon, about which I will be saying more in this letter later this month.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Our success starts with our hardworking faculty and staff – I am grateful for their commitment to excellence. And I appreciate that our alumni and friends support UI’s work and share the Vandal success story far and wide. That makes a difference. You make a difference. Thanks for a great year, and I look forward to our brave and bold future.

2016-10-14,These Great Rankings Tell Our Story,"<p></p> 
<p>Autumn means a season for changing leaves, football weekends and mid-term exams. It’s also a time when future college students closely examine their options for higher education. Students and families often rely on college guides and rankings to make college decisions. Rankings help guide a more nuanced approach to college selection than word-of-mouth or the impressions of friends, however well-meaning. But understanding the basis of rankings is important. Armed with that information, I hope that you will help friends understand the excellence of our premier research university.<br /> <br /> Every year we see an abundance of rankings and comparisons, each with a unique combination of metrics and weighting. Some rankings weight reputation or the quality of the incoming student body. I put a higher value on the student experience and on student outcomes, especially real-world career success after college.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> U.S. News and World Report is a widely-used, traditional ranking. The University of Idaho does well in this annual ranking – <a  href=""http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/university-of-idaho-142285/overall-rankings"" target=""_blank"">No. 171 among national universities</a> for 2017, with highly ranked programs in business and engineering. Worth noting, though, is that US News weights reputation (assessed by a survey of college administrators) and student selectivity highly. Student selectivity is essentially how many qualified students an institution turns away. I feel that education should be accessible for all qualified students; we have a mission to expand access, not restrict it. If lower student selectivity at UI dents an otherwise strong ranking, we accept that because we want to be measured on how many great students we bring in the door and graduate, not how many we lock out.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> This fall the federal government updated its <a  href=""https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/search/?state=ID&size=small&size=medium&size=large&control=public&sort=advantage:desc"" target=""_blank"">College Scorecard </a>– not a ranking, per se, but a tool for learning more about institutions and comparing them. Clear-cut, authoritative and fact-based, it allows one to compare institutions based on measures such as average annual costs, six-year graduation rate, and financial success after college. The data are drawn from those students who received federal financial aid – more than half of our students and a very important population for us to serve. The College Scorecard gets to the heart of three critical factors every family needs to consider – cost to them, probability of their graduation, and what their career outcome will be. UI scores better than the national average in all categories, and best among all four-year public universities in Idaho.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> This summer UI was named one of <a  href=""http://time.com/money/best-colleges/rankings/best-colleges//"" target=""_blank"">Money magazine’s “Best Colleges”</a> and the <a  href=""http://time.com/money/4398295/best-college-in-every-state/?xid=time_socialflow_twitter"" target=""_blank"">best school in Idaho.</a>&nbsp;Quality of education, affordability and outcomes inform Money’s rankings. Some of their data come from the College Scorecard, and some come from <a  href=""https://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report/best-schools-by-state/bachelors/idaho"" target=""_blank"">PayScale</a>. This very practical ranking helps students answer key questions: Is the academic experience excellent? Can I afford it? Will it pay off with a good job? Our success on this ranking offers a resounding “Yes” to all three questions.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The <a  href=""http://washingtonmonthly.com/college_guide?ranking=2016-rankings-national-universities"" target=""_blank"">Washington Monthly</a> ranking takes a data-driven approach – no survey where administrators offer at-a-distance opinions on intangibles – and dials down on accessibility to families with financial need and service to first-generation students. Washington Monthly also assesses student success, innovative research and public service (we score especially high on service – this week we made our sixth consecutive appearance on the <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2016-october/101216-volunteerism?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=101416&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=Volunteerism&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" target=""_blank"">President’s Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll</a>, further proof of that commitment). UI is again one of America's top 100 national universities, No. 84, and clearly the highest-ranked university in Idaho. We're also a &quot;Best Bang for Your Buck&quot; college based on the return on investment a UI degree offers graduates.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Not all rankings are created equal. Nevertheless, as students look ahead to their own fall days at our great university, I hope they’ll take advantage of the many well-informed rankings that are out there to help guide their decision-making. Our rankings prove that the University of Idaho will serve them well, as we have for 127 years.</p> 
<span>Go Vandals!<br /> Chuck Staben<br /> President<br /> <br /> P.S. I want to congratulate our College of Law for its appearance on the cover of this month’s PreLaw magazine — we are the <a  href=""http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/cypress/prelaw_2016fall/index.php#/1"" target=""_blank"">No. 8 Best Value Law School</a> in the nation. The program is helping students reduce debt and prepare for employment. For affordability and career success, our Law program exemplifies Vandal excellence, and I’m glad it’s getting noticed.</span>

2016-10-21,Announcing Our Plans for an Arena at UI&nbsp;,"<p></p> 
<p>For the two years of my presidency, my highest fundraising priority has been building a new arena for basketball and volleyball at the University of Idaho. Today I’m formally announcing the public phase of our campaign to <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/giving/athletics/idaho-arena?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=102116&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=IdahoArenaGiving&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" target=""_blank"">build an arena in Moscow</a>. This project is an investment in our student-athletes, a great student experience and an exciting campus environment for alumni, fans and the entire community. It is an investment in excellence.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Located on the field north of the ASUI-Kibbie Activity Center, the arena will be an outstanding place to build on our tradition of athletic success. Including a new practice court, office and conference space, the facility will alleviate the space constraints we face with basketball’s conflict with football in fall and with the Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival in spring. This adaptable, modern facility will help our basketball and volleyball programs compete for Big Sky Conference championships year in and year out. As Athletic Director Rob Spear puts it, “This will be one of the most impactful projects in the history of our athletic department. A new facility can transform and elevate our court sports to new heights.”&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The impact on recruiting will be tangible, too. The Cowan Spectrum has done a wonderful job for many years, but it’s time to build a facility that helps us consistently recruit outstanding student-athletes and maintain the Division I excellence we have every right to expect as Vandals. Our women’s basketball team has been to the NCAA tournament three of the past four seasons. Our men’s team just had their best season in 20 years. Let’s use that as a launching pad for the next generation of successful Vandal athletes.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> A new arena also enhances the student experience at UI. Students will be excited about heading to a game — or a concert, conference or lecture — in a space that is designed for those experiences. I’m thrilled that our student government at ASUI backs this plan. The facilities fee they originated and passed is the seed funding that will allow this idea to grow. We’ll see opportunities for faculty and hands-on student involvement in all phases of this project — from our art and architecture Design Lab, to our natural resources programs, to civil engineering. Upon completion, students in movement sciences, journalism, marketing and more will find the facility a practical place to exercise their emerging talents and skills.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> This is a building that represents Idaho, and, accordingly, we’ve been working with Idaho’s forest products industry. Wood is a central design element in the building’s 4,700-seat, 70,000-square-foot design. As Idaho’s land-grant research leader, we plan to demonstrate what it means to build a cutting-edge facility with our state’s abundant renewable resource.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> In total, we have over half of the project cost committed. Student support has been pivotal. I want to thank the Associated Students of the University of Idaho (ASUI) for recognizing the need for this project and stepping up with fee support that can be used to bond up to $5 million of the arena cost. We have other commitments from generous friends of the university. Our next steps are to ask for the <a  href=""https://www.sites.uidaho.edu/giving/givingform.aspx?presets=RF176&amp;giftid=RF176"" target=""_blank"">support of all our alumni and friends</a>. While completing our fundraising, we plan to ask the State Board of Education for approval to plan and bid the construction in February 2017. I know that ASUI President Cruz Botello and others share my hope that entering freshmen in fall 2017 will cheer on the Vandals in the arena during their senior year.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;<br /> This is a game-changing project for our campus, for our athletics program and for Idaho. Together, let’s <a  href=""https://www.sites.uidaho.edu/giving/givingform.aspx?presets=RF176&amp;giftid=RF176"" target=""_blank"">build something special</a> at the University of Idaho.</p>

2016-10-28,Our Enrollment Growth at UI,"<p></p> 
<p>This is an exciting time at the University of Idaho. Last week we announced the public campaign for a <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/giving/athletics/idaho-arena?utm_source=University+of+Idaho&amp;utm_campaign=44791a405f-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2016_10_27&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_18a9cb4835-44791a405f-"">new arena for basketball and volleyball</a>. The arena will enrich UI’s great residential experience and offer outstanding facilities to our student-athletes in all court sports. Our students want this facility, and have stepped forward to support it. Consider investing in this game-changing facility yourself.</p> 
<p class=""p1"">We’ve also made <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2016-october/101916-enrollment2016?utm_source=University+of+Idaho&amp;utm_campaign=44791a405f-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2016_10_27&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_18a9cb4835-44791a405f-"">enrollment gains</a>&nbsp;— an important trend for UI and our state. Overall, our enrollment increased 3.6 percent, to 11,780. We realized a 6.5 percent increase in new Idaho resident freshman, amid a 4.5 increase in overall new freshmen. For in-state students, the Direct Admissions program, spurred by UI in partnership with our State Board of Education, is part of that success story. Direct Admissions offered automatic admission to qualified high school seniors and resulted in a 5 percent system-wide increase, according to 10th-day state board enrollment data, in addition to the gains at UI.&nbsp;</p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>One Direct Admissions anecdote needs to be shared, from a new freshman from Boise whose high school career had been “up and down.” The Direct Admissions letter he received informing him that he was admitted to the University of Idaho was the first time he’d imagined our university was a possibility. He hadn’t thought he could get accepted. He’s now a freshman on campus in one of our fraternities, enthusiastic about his classes and taking every advantage of an opportunity he didn’t even know he’d earned. I know there are many students like him, including many first-generation college attendees who make up nearly one-third of our student body this fall.</span></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>We’ve also seen an increase in new transfer students, both from Idaho and beyond, 8.6 and 4.9 percent, respectively. Those Idaho students benefit from <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/admissions/apply/transfer/vandalink"">VandaLink agreements</a> with North Idaho College, the College of Western Idaho, the College of Southern Idaho and Eastern Idaho Technical College. VandaLink provides a seamless transfer of credits and scholarship support for the many community college students who are ready to take on a four-year degree.</span></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>We are a diverse, inclusive and global campus. The percentage of students from underrepresented groups in our freshman class rose from 16 percent to 23.2 percent. That increase grows out of strong work by our diversity advisory groups, our admissions and recruiting teams, and special programs such as our <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/diversity/dhr/native-american-student-center/scholarships/tribal-excellence?utm_source=University+of+Idaho&amp;utm_campaign=44791a405f-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2016_10_27&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_18a9cb4835-44791a405f-"">Tribal Excellence Scholarship</a>. This fall students come to UI from all 50 states and Washington, D.C., 79 countries, and the U.S. territories of American Samoa and the Virgin Islands.</span></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>I want to keep building on our success. We’re continuing to lead the charge in the Direct Admissions initiative. High school students across Idaho — maybe one you know, maybe your own child — may have already received notification of automatic admission to the University of Idaho, based on their academic qualifications. I encourage those students — and I hope you will, too — to take the next steps, save their spots at UI, and get started with financial aid at <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/admissions/apply?utm_source=University+of+Idaho&amp;utm_campaign=44791a405f-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2016_10_27&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_18a9cb4835-44791a405f-"">uidaho.edu/apply</a>. Federal changes mean you can fill out FAFSA right now, using last year’s taxes. UI has moved its <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/financial-aid/scholarships?utm_source=University+of+Idaho&amp;utm_campaign=44791a405f-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2016_10_27&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_18a9cb4835-44791a405f-"">financial aid priority date</a> to Dec. 1 so that students and families will know their financial aid awards by the holidays – more time to make the best decision for a great education. And as of this fall, we have waived the application fee for Idaho residents. We will forego about $200,000 in revenue — an investment we are making in the future of Idaho students.</span></p>

2016-11-03,Our Native American Partnerships,"<p></p> 
<p class=""p1"">The University of Idaho is dedicated to serving all people. Our student body is more diverse than ever. This year's increase in enrollment includes more students who identify as Native American, reflecting on our strong partnership with regional tribes.</p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>This fall saw a 9.8 percent increase in Native American students at UI. Contributing factors to that growth include our <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/diversity/dhr/native-american-student-center/scholarships/tribal-excellence?utm_source=University+of+Idaho&amp;utm_campaign=5325aba725-Friday+Letter_2016_11_04&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_18a9cb4835-5325aba725-"">Tribal Excellence Scholarship</a>, which extends the equivalent of in-state tuition to members of the 10 tribes with which UI has a memorandum of understanding (MOU) and to tribal college transfer students. That program emerged through consultation with our MOU tribes, who have representatives on campus this week for annual meetings. Our Native American Education Advisory Board and Native American Advisory Council discuss issues and opportunities for enhanced work in many facets of our partnership. I appreciate the chance to connect with UI’s tribal partners to keep building on success for students at UI, at the <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/diversity/dhr/native-american-student-center?utm_source=University+of+Idaho&amp;utm_campaign=5325aba725-Friday+Letter_2016_11_04&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_18a9cb4835-5325aba725-"">undergraduate</a> and <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/law/academics/emphasis-area/native-american-law?utm_source=University+of+Idaho&amp;utm_campaign=5325aba725-Friday+Letter_2016_11_04&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_18a9cb4835-5325aba725-"">graduate</a> levels, and to see where we can continue to meet needs in the K-12 system and in the community.</span></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>Today we <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2016-november/110316-nativeamericanheritagemonth?utm_source=University+of+Idaho&amp;utm_campaign=5325aba725-Friday+Letter_2016_11_04&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_18a9cb4835-5325aba725-"">dedicate flags</a> from our 10 MOU partners in a common area in the Bruce M. Pitman Center. The new Tribal Nations Lounge is a place of welcome. Thanks to Yolanda Bisbee, chief diversity officer and executive director of Tribal Relations, for her efforts to create a more visible place that shares some of the area’s tribal history, art and culture with the UI community. In dedicating this space, we recognize UI’s location on Nez Perce ceded land and demonstrate our deeply held commitment to serving Native American students with educational opportunities. We will have pictures of the dedication ceremony later today – please <a  href=""https://www.facebook.com/uidahopresident?utm_source=University+of+Idaho&amp;utm_campaign=5325aba725-Friday+Letter_2016_11_04&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_18a9cb4835-5325aba725-"" target=""_blank"">visit my Facebook page</a>.&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>Throughout November, UI is celebrating <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2015-october/102815-nahm?utm_source=University+of+Idaho&amp;utm_campaign=5325aba725-Friday+Letter_2016_11_04&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_18a9cb4835-5325aba725-"">Native American Heritage month</a>, just one of the many ways we honor our tribal members. Last month, I accepted an ASUI resolution to commemorate <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2016-october/101016-indigenouspeoplesday?utm_source=University+of+Idaho&amp;utm_campaign=5325aba725-Friday+Letter_2016_11_04&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_18a9cb4835-5325aba725-"">“Indigenous Peoples Day”</a> at UI. I appreciated hearing from our guest speaker, Nez Perce elder Mike Penney, and appreciate the work put into commemorating this day by ASUI and our <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/diversity/dhr/native-american-student-center/about/native-american-student-association?utm_source=University+of+Idaho&amp;utm_campaign=5325aba725-Friday+Letter_2016_11_04&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_18a9cb4835-5325aba725-"">Native American Student Association</a>. I hope Indigenous Peoples Day – like UI's annual Tutxinmepu Powwow each spring –&nbsp; becomes a widely celebrated part of UI's commitment to inclusion of Native American people, experiences and perspectives.</span></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>&nbsp;Outreach to Native American communities also informs our relationship with tribes. This summer we hosted high school students through our <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/diversity/dhr/native-american-student-center/academics/hoist?utm_source=University+of+Idaho&amp;utm_campaign=5325aba725-Friday+Letter_2016_11_04&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_18a9cb4835-5325aba725-"">Helping Orient Indian Students and Teachers into STEM (HOIST)</a> college-prep program, giving students a leg up toward college. This spring we won a National Science Foundation grant to <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2016-march/032416-tribalstem?utm_source=University+of+Idaho&amp;utm_campaign=5325aba725-Friday+Letter_2016_11_04&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_18a9cb4835-5325aba725-"">bring more Native American students</a> to the McCall Outdoor Science School and follow up in the classroom to create culturally relevant connections to STEM topics. Our College of Natural Resources, with help from University Distinguished Professor Lisette Waits, is leading the development of a Tribal Natural Resources Certificate. As a final example, our College of Education, led by associate professor Vanessa Anthony-Stevens, <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/ed/ci/features/ikeep"">partners with the Nez Perce and Coeur d’Alene tribes</a> to build reciprocal relationships and understanding between teachers and tribal communities through the Indigenous Knowledge for Effective Education Program project.</span></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>I have appreciated building relationships with our tribal partners. Those partnerships create a richer, more inclusive and more diverse UI for all students.</span></p>

Operation Education, a unique support program celebrating its 10th anniversary this year, exemplifies that culture of appreciation, respect and support.<br /> <br /> <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/operation-education"">Operation Education</a> provides academic, social and financial support to those who have received service-related injuries since Sept. 11, 2011, as well as their spouses and families. In 10 years, the program has supported the educational aspirations of nearly 30 people. Operation Education scholars have graduated in a diverse array of undergraduate and graduate programs, in everything from public relations to civil engineering to natural resources to law.<br /> <br /> We currently host six full-time students at UI. <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/feature-stories/oped-anniversary?utm_source=University+of+Idaho&amp;utm_campaign=d94e6beab0-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2016_11_11&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_18a9cb4835-d94e6beab0-"">Read the story of Aaron Torres</a>, a first-generation American who joined the U.S. Army Airborne Infantry in 2008, wanting to do his part for his country. That service took him to Iraq. With support from Operation Education, and thanks to his hard work and determination, Aaron is on a path to graduating with a bachelor’s degree in anthropology and archaeology. I have no doubt he will go far.<br /> <br /> Tonight we’ll celebrate this decade of commitment at our annual UI Veterans Appreciation Dinner. We are honored to be joined by Aaron and Bonnie Contreras, two of the first Operation Education scholars. Aaron, our guest speaker, graduated from UI’s College of Law in 2010 and is an active duty Army Judge Advocate General (JAG) captain. Bonnie is a 2010 College of Education graduate and a school psychologist. These two scholars epitomize the Vandal spirit, alongside Operation Education’s many other scholar alumni, current students and supporters.<br /> <br /> When Mary Beth and I came to UI, Operation Education was one of the first programs in which Mary Beth became deeply involved, serving as honorary co-chair of the effort with Bonnie Amos, wife of UI alumnus and then-Marine Corps Commandant General James F. Amos.

Dan Button, our veterans advisor, helps so many veterans reach their goals, fostering a supportive environment at UI for our military.<br /> <br /> This life-changing program is an important way UI can recognize and support those who have given so much for our country. Thank you to our military community — cadets, active-duty students and veterans — for making a sacrifice for something larger than yourselves.

2016-11-18,From Idaho to the U.S. Capitol,"<p></p> 
<p>This holiday season, Idaho residents can share the pride of knowing the tree shining at the U.S. Capitol glows with a little extra silver and gold flair, cut from the heart of our beautiful state.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Known as “the People’s Tree,” this stately evergreen is telling the story of Idaho — and of us as the state’s land-grant university. This designation gives UI a distinct mission to provide access to higher education across our state, to conduct innovative research and to engage our statewide community.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> This year's tree hails from the Payette National Forest near our McCall Field Campus. For more than 75 years, the McCall Field Campus has been a critical part of our effort to bring more students to college. UI’s&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/cnr/mccall-outdoor-science-school"" target=""_blank"">McCall Outdoor Science School</a>&nbsp;has delivered hands-on learning opportunities to more than 20,000 K-12 students from across Idaho. More than 1,000 teachers have participated in professional training that equips them to prepare our next generation.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The U.S. Capitol Christmas Tree represents our historic role in research connected to natural resources, especially through our&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/cnr"" target=""_blank"">College of Natural Resources</a>. Our ready access to facilities, forests and wilderness areas provide students unmatched opportunities to work in the field. Among those resources is the 10,000-acre&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/cnr/ui-experimental-forest"" target=""_blank"">UI Experimental Forest</a>, just 20 minutes from our Moscow campus. The&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/cnr/taylor-wilderness-research-station"" target=""_blank"">Taylor Wilderness Research Station</a>&nbsp;in the heart of the Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness is a home like no other for faculty and student research — 70 percent of UI natural resources students get involved in research. These assets and experiences have helped make the College of Natural Resources a top 10 natural resource college, according to USA Today.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The U.S. Capitol Christmas Tree&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2016-november/110716-capitolchristmastree"" target=""_blank"">stopped at the University of Idaho in Moscow last week</a>&nbsp;on its way across the country to Washington, D.C., and many UI students and employees added their holiday greetings to the truck. You can view photos of its visit to Moscow&nbsp;<a  href=""https://www.facebook.com/uidahopresident"" target=""_blank"">on my Facebook page</a>.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> As the tree continues its national tour, it symbolizes many things — the beauty of our state, the traditions of family and community, and a sense of national unity. We can be proud that this symbol of Christmas spirit came from Idaho, and proud of the role that the University of Idaho plays in studying, protecting and preserving our beautiful forests.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The tree symbolizes a promise of a bright future for our state, our nation and our institution. I am glad that our state, our Idaho, can help share that story.<br /> <br /> Go Vandals!<br /> Chuck Staben</p>

2016-12-02,A Year of Progress at UI,"<p></p> 
<p class=""p1"">This has been an exciting year at the University of Idaho. Across our statewide campus, new programs, initiatives and facilities are making an impact. The hard work of our faculty and staff has been complemented by the commitment of our students, alumni and friends. Our <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/president/communications/annual-report?utm_source=University+of+Idaho&amp;utm_campaign=d44000395e-Friday+Letter_2016-12-02&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_18a9cb4835-d44000395e-"">2016 Annual Report</a>, released this week, captures some of those successes and lays the groundwork for future excellence.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The annual report is used to assess our progress and adjust efforts in the next year. It sets a baseline for gauging our impact in key areas — research and scholarship, teaching and learning, and outreach and engagement. In coming years, expect to see annual progress on our <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/provost/strategic-plan?utm_source=University+of+Idaho&amp;utm_campaign=d44000395e-Friday+Letter_2016-12-02&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_18a9cb4835-d44000395e-"">strategic plan goals</a> documented here.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The annual report offers a chance for reflection and assessment. Where are we doing well? Where could we be stronger? Readers will also find a focus on the intangibles that make us who we are: our mission and vision, as well as our institutional principles and values of excellence, respect, integrity, perseverance and sustainability. These are concepts that unite us; they are not just words, but deeply held commitments to beliefs and practices.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The report also highlights the tangible excellence we achieved in the past year. We grew our enrollment, including bringing more Idaho students into higher education through the <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/admissions/direct-admissions?utm_source=University+of+Idaho&amp;utm_campaign=d44000395e-Friday+Letter_2016-12-02&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_18a9cb4835-d44000395e-"">Direct Admissions</a> initiative. We completed a total renovation of our <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/ed/about/building?utm_source=University+of+Idaho&amp;utm_campaign=d44000395e-Friday+Letter_2016-12-02&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_18a9cb4835-d44000395e-"">College of Education building</a> and a remodel of our Wallace Residence Center. We created a new <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/research/students/undergraduate-research?utm_source=University+of+Idaho&amp;utm_campaign=d44000395e-Friday+Letter_2016-12-02&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_18a9cb4835-d44000395e-"">Office of Undergraduate Research</a> and spurred innovation with the Vandal Ideas Project. Our <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/research?utm_source=University+of+Idaho&amp;utm_campaign=d44000395e-Friday+Letter_2016-12-02&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_18a9cb4835-d44000395e-"">land-grant research footprint</a> surpassed $100 million in research expenditures. And we set our sights on a market-based compensation system as part of our dedication to fostering an outstanding work environment. These are but a few examples — see the full report for more.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> I have intentionally used the first person plural in discussing these successes. Individual efforts are important, but these accomplishments are not something any one of us does alone. We come together as a university community — and that includes our alumni and supporters — to build a better UI for our students and our state. We all have valuable roles to play.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> That collaboration has our institution moving forward. We have made great progress this year, and we have outstanding success to build on in the years ahead. I say it often because it’s true: We are a brave and bold institution. So in the words of our fight song, let’s “all bear down for Idaho.”<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Go mighty Vandals!<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Chuck Staben<br /> President<br /> &nbsp;<br /> P.S. With a 7-4 record with one game left in the season, our Vandal football team is bowl eligible! We will have information to share soon about which bowl game we will be playing in. Congratulations to the Vandal football student-athletes, coaches and staff. The football team’s motto, “Expect to Win,” aptly describes the brave and bold way Vandals have approached this season on and off the field. It’s also a great attitude to apply to endeavors across UI life and work.

2016-12-09,The Story Our Graduates Write,"<p></p> 
<p class=""p1"">This Saturday 634 Vandals cross the stage at our <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2016-november/112816-fallcommencement?utm_source=University+of+Idaho&amp;utm_campaign=7c8933e683-Friday+Letter_2016_12_09&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_18a9cb4835-7c8933e683-"">fall Commencement</a> and take their place among the more than 116,000 graduates of our state’s leading national research university. We celebrate their accomplishments, their hard work, their persistence and their creativity. Our Vandals have spent long days, nights, weeks and years getting to the Kibbie Dome this Saturday. They are prepared for the great career and satisfying life that come with a University of Idaho degree.</p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>Graduation is one of the pivotal moments we have in life. It’s a chance to reflect on who you are and who you will be.</span></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>During the holiday season, one timeless tale that touches on those themes of personal growth and reflection is Charles Dickens’ “A Christmas Carol.” This December, our Theatre Arts Department in the College of Letters, Arts and Social Sciences is staging its<a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/class/theatre/productions-and-events/christmas-carol""> fourth consecutive and final production of this Christmas classic</a>, which offers universal lessons, transcending any particular faith or creed. I will draw on lessons from the story to share with our graduates tomorrow.</span></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>The story is familiar to many — Mary Beth and I enjoyed it with our children countless times. Ebenezer Scrooge is a wealthy but miserly man who receives visitations from a series of ghosts — specters from the past, present and future. The first shows him the love and warmth he forsook for greed. The second shows him the joy others experience in the holiday season, even amid the hardship faced by the Cratchit family. The last shows Scrooge a world where his death is not mourned, in contrast with the untimely passing of Tiny Tim.&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>It is a haunting vision, and Scrooge emerges a changed man. He’s received an opportunity that only occurs in novels and movies, unfortunately — the chance to see your future made real and change it before it comes to pass. That’s the important lesson I want our graduates to take away: retain the capacity to change, both personally and to impact the world around you.&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>Our graduates have the chance to be the person they want to be — thinkers, doers, leaders, friends and helpers. People who are both ambitious and generous. Beyond their own success, I’ll ask them to think about the impact they want to see around them. What challenges need their skills? What injustice requires their attention? What broader opportunity can come to life with their diligence? Vandals are leaders and successful in all walks of life — they are uniquely positioned to make the world around them a better place. In the words of “A Christmas Carol” co-directors David Lee-Painter and Daniel Haley, “Be the blessing.” One can think of that as “Be that future” — embody the future you want to see, and work to create it.</span></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>Those are chapters that our graduates start to write this Saturday. They are prepared with an outstanding education, with a network of friends and mentors, and with a <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/alumni?utm_source=University+of+Idaho&amp;utm_campaign=7c8933e683-Friday+Letter_2016_12_09&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_18a9cb4835-7c8933e683-"">Vandal alumni family</a> whose passion is unmatched.<br /> <br /> Go Vandals!<br /> <br /> Chuck Staben<br /> President</span><br /> <br /> </p>

2016-12-16,Happy Holidays from the University of Idaho,"<p></p> 
<p>Mary Beth and I are delighted to wish you happy holidays. Whether you are in Idaho or elsewhere, thank you for being a part of the Vandal family. I hope you will enjoy the harmony of our Vandaleers, who have been singing our Alma Mater since 1930. Please <a  href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGEL6qi9hN8&amp;feature=youtu.be"" target=""_blank"">share this video</a> with family and friends — we can all look ahead to a great future for the best university in Idaho, winning our way to fame.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <em>Chuck Staben</em><br /> <em>President</em><br /> <br /> <strong>A Season of Giving<br /> </strong></p> 
<p class=""p1"">Many of our alumni and friends choose to <a  href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/giving/make-a-gift?utm_source=University+of+Idaho&utm_campaign=12cb4d8e97-Friday+Letter_2016_12_09&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_18a9cb4835-12cb4d8e97-"" target=""_blank"">make their gifts</a> to the university during this season of giving and before the end of the calendar year. And many times alumni choose to invest in our students — students like Olivia Dowling.&nbsp;</p> 
<p class=""p1"">Olivia Dowling ‘16, embodies the energy, curiosity, and determination of University of Idaho students. In high school Olivia had a passion for forging relationships with everyone around her, and she has always been drawn to good advertising with a powerful message.</p> 
<p class=""p1"">Olivia combined her love of people with her passion for persuasive communication by choosing to study advertising, one of the many degrees offered in The University of Idaho School of Journalism and Mass Media (JAMM).</p> 
<p class=""p1"">Olivia is a first generation college student from Alaska and going to school so far away from home created many challenges, but UI instantly felt like home and she has loved her time here. Her JAMM professors inspire her to succeed by requiring excellence in all things.</p> 
<p class=""p1"">Like many students, she works full time during the summers and work a couple of part time jobs during the school year to help pay her tuition, books and room and board, but she would not be here without donor support of student scholarships and programs.</p> 
<p class=""p1"">You can help to make experiences like this possible for students like Olivia. Each time you give, you make someone's dream of a University of Idaho degree a reality.</p> 
<p class=""p1"">As we wrap up the fall semester and greet the holiday season, please consider the University of Idaho in your year-end <a  href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/giving/make-a-gift?utm_source=University+of+Idaho&utm_campaign=12cb4d8e97-Friday+Letter_2016_12_09&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_18a9cb4835-12cb4d8e97-"" target=""_blank"">giving</a>.<br /> <br /> </p>

<p>Welcome to an exciting new year at the University of Idaho. We have no shortage of work to do in the year ahead. But I want to reflect on the progress we made in 2016, accomplishments that provide forward momentum for our university. Here are four key areas where UI is excelling:</p> 
<ol> 
 <li> <p><em>Increasing enrollment.</em> Fall 2016 brought to UI the <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2016-october/101916-enrollment2016"" target=""_blank"">first overall enrollment increase</a> since 2012. Our <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/admissions/direct-admissions"" target=""_blank"">Direct Admissions</a> initiative in partnership with the state has opened the door to more Idaho students (a 6.5 percent increase in Idaho freshmen), including many who are among the first generation in their families to go to college. We know that for most people higher education is the best pathway for good jobs and great lives, so it’s essential that we keep building on this success. In 2016 we <a  href=""https://www.uiargonaut.com/2016/09/14/a-home-state-advantage-staben-works-to-eliminate-60-application-fee-for-in-state-students/"" target=""_blank"">eliminated our application fee for Idaho residents</a>, and continue to offer the most scholarship support in our state. Growth is good for students, good for Idaho and good for UI.<br /> <br /> </p> </li> 
 <li> <p><em>Expanding innovation.</em> In 2016, UI topped $100 million in research expenditures. We are far and away <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/research"" target=""_blank"">Idaho’s research leader</a> — that $100 million is more than double the research of all other Idaho institutions combined. That research, scholarship and creative activity makes a difference for our state in fields such as agriculture, engineering, clean energy, arts and culture, and more. One example of that always evolving impact can be found in our new partnership at <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/cnr/rangeland-center/projects/rock-creek"" target=""_blank"">Rock Creek Ranch</a>, launched in summer 2016, which will study how to manage our rangeland at the intersection of grazing and conservation.<br /> <br /> </p> </li> 
 <li> <p><em>Leading the way in transformative excellence.</em> Our university stands out for success in and out of the classroom. From our acclaimed <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/academic-affairs/university-honors-program"" target=""_blank"">University Honors Program</a>, to our <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2016-october/101216-volunteerism"" target=""_blank"">nationally recognized student servic</a><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2016-october/101216-volunteerism"" target=""_blank"">e</a>, to our Northwest-leading cadre of National Merit Scholars, our students set a high bar for excellence on their way to the <a  href=""https://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report/best-schools-by-state/bachelors/idaho"" target=""_blank"">best career outcomes of any Idaho institution</a>. Our students took advantage of unique experiences available on our residential campus, whether participating in one of 200 student organizations or in unique UI opportunities such as our <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/cnr/semester-in-the-wild"" target=""_blank"">Semester in the Wild</a> program or our <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/campus-recreation/outdoor-program"" target=""_blank"">acclaimed Outdoor Program</a>. Our athletics program capped a season of championships in women’s basketball, women’s soccer, women’s tennis, and men’s and women’s golf with a resounding football victory in the <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/events/special-interest-events/athletics/bowl-game"" target=""_blank"">Famous Idaho Potato Bowl in Boise</a>.<br /> <br /> </p> </li> 
 <li> <p><em>Serving our state.</em> We are the University of <em>Idaho</em>, and we are committed to serving the entire state as its land-grant institution. Our mission sees us producing Idaho’s leaders in many fields — in <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/academics/wwami"" target=""_blank"">medicine</a>, in <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/law"" target=""_blank"">law</a>, in public service and more. <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/cals/idaho-agricultural-experiment-station"" target=""_blank"">Facilities across Idaho</a> anchor our partnership with communities and industry. Whether in farm fields, on the range, in 4-H groups, or in local classrooms and community centers, the University of Idaho remains a vital part of the fabric of Idaho. &nbsp;</p> </li> 
</ol> 
<p> Clearly, we are well-positioned for continued success. I thank our statewide faculty and staff for their hard work, innovation and commitment. Importantly, our <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/alumni"" target=""_blank"">alumni and friends</a> champion our university and support its mission with time, enthusiasm and philanthropy. Thank you contributing to our shared success.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> If you haven’t seen it already, please enjoy the video below that highlights a great 2016. I look forward to working with you on the challenges and opportunities 2017 brings.<br /> <br /> Go Vandals!<br /> <em>Chuck Staben<br /> President</em></p>

2017-01-13,The Task for Idaho Higher Education,"<p></p> 
<p class=""p1"">Last week, Gov. Otter announced the <a  href=""https://gov.idaho.gov/mediacenter/press/pr2017/1_January/pr_02.html"" target=""_blank"">formation of a Higher Education Task Force</a> to develop a five-year plan for higher education in Idaho, building on the work of the K-12 task force, whose 2013 recommendations are in the third year of implementation. The Higher Education Task Force has the same potential to influence policymaking. The 28-member committee will be comprised of higher education administrators, business and community leaders, and students. I look forward to studying the issues and working with my fellow task force members to develop recommendations that strengthen higher education in Idaho.</p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>My responsibility on the committee is to take a balanced view of systemwide needs, but also to advance an understanding of how our land-grant, national research university adds to the higher education landscape in Idaho. In other words, how can our state’s system be improved, and how can Idaho invest so that higher education contributes even greater value? I’m interested to assess how we can better use UI’s strengths: making higher education accessible to Idaho citizens, conducting innovative research that unlocks new knowledge and spurs economic development, and engaging with the communities we serve.</span></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>My presidency has focused in large part on bringing more Idahoans into higher education. The state’s <a  href=""https://boardofed.idaho.gov/education-initiatives/complete-college-idaho-a-plan-for-growing-talent/"" target=""_blank"">60 percent goal for postsecondary completion</a> is an important marker, and we will need new ideas and new investments to achieve that goal. Enhancing Idaho’s college-going culture was the motivation for the Direct Admissions program — a program that benefits not just UI but all Idaho higher education institutions — and for our many other efforts to expand college access and retain affordability. We know that higher education is increasingly essential for individual success. <a  href=""https://cew.georgetown.edu/cew-reports/americas-divided-recovery/?utm_source=University+of+Idaho&amp;utm_campaign=99ec9c2490-Friday+Letter_2017_01_13&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_18a9cb4835-99ec9c2490-"" target=""_blank"">More than 95 percent (11.5 million) of new jobs</a> created since the Great Recession have gone to people with at least some postsecondary education. Want a great job? Want a great life? Now more than ever, it starts with going to college.</span></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>Public investment in affordable postsecondary education is critical if we want to help students get to college and succeed there. I want to make sure our investment in higher education — an investment that already delivers returns many times over — is aligned in the most effective and efficient way possible to meet the demands of our students and our state in a fast-changing economy. We have partnerships with the K-12 system, with fellow higher education institutions, and with businesses and communities that can all be enhanced to deliver even greater returns.</span></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>I share Gov. Otter’s confidence in the task force members, led by Linda Clark, State Board of Education member, and Bob Lokken, the CEO of White Cloud Analytics and president of Idaho Business for Education. I look forward to hearing from my fellow task force members, and to exploring how the state can ensure that UI and all our partners can do more to help Idaho continue to grow and thrive.<br /> <br /> Go Vandals!<br /> <em>Chuck Staben<br /> President</em></span></p>

2017-01-20,Changing 'The Way It Is',"<p></p> 
<p class=""p1"">On Monday, we celebrated Martin Luther King Jr.-Idaho Human Rights Day. It’s a chance to honor the progress of civil rights in our country and our state, to continue to that work through local service, and to reflect on the future we want to see in the world.</p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>Let me share one story. When I taught at the University of Kentucky, the university encouraged faculty members to honor Dr. King in some way, but we did not have the day off — classes were held. For several years, as a relatively new teacher, I didn’t know how to honor the day. Mostly, I could not think how Dr. King was relevant to the microbiology or genetics I was teaching.&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>In 1994, Mary Beth and I purchased a home that had been part of a development in 1948. The deed had a restriction that was common in 1948, but that anyone today would recognize as illegal and immoral. The deed said that we could not sell or rent our property “to any Negro or mulatto,” in the language of that time, nor to any “association” of the same. Furthermore, an African-American could reside on the property, but only in the capacity of a domestic servant.</span></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>I was so struck by this deed that for years, each Martin Luther King Jr. Day, I projected it for the 150 students in my genetics class and asked them what they thought. Undergraduates are often shy about responding to any question, but eventually a student would volunteer that it was illegal, and that it was wrong. Sometimes they would use even stronger language.</span></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>I agreed, of course, and pointed out that this clause was common in 1948, found even up until 1960 in Lexington. In part because of the heroic actions of people like Dr. King, we now recognized how wrong such discrimination is. I would then ask the class to cast themselves back 40 years, though, back to when their grandparents might have been students in the class. What would they have thought? That’s a tougher question. Some would have been upset. But many people in 1955 would have thought this was a routine fact of life, not an injustice — “just the way it is.”</span></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>So I asked my students, and it remains worth considering: 40 years from today, what will your grandchildren marvel at that we didn’t see in the same way?</span></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>Today, we undoubtedly still have blind spots. I am proud, though, of how <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/diversity?utm_source=University+of+Idaho&amp;utm_campaign=57d7283020-Friday+Letter_2017_01_20&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_18a9cb4835-57d7283020-"">our students, staff and leadership</a> come together with <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/diversity/dhr/oma/events/mlk-day?utm_source=University+of+Idaho&amp;utm_campaign=57d7283020-Friday+Letter_2017_01_20&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_18a9cb4835-57d7283020-"">meaningful programming</a> — seminars, food drives, community events and more — around this special day. That spirit of service and struggle builds on a wonderful legacy, helping ensure that in the years to come we will live in a better world, and look back with pride on progress.</span></p>

2017-01-27,A Special Week in Boise,"<p></p> 
<p>This week Vandals converged on our state Capitol for “Higher Education Week.” It’s a time for sharing the University of Idaho story with our Legislature, meeting future Vandals at our annual downtown Boise recruiting event, and recognizing our great alumni at the Ada County Silver and Gold Awards celebration.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> I was proud to <a  href=""http://www.spokesman.com/blogs/boise/2017/jan/25/staben-talks-research-attracting-students-tuition-ui-and-more/%20"" target=""_blank"">explain UI’s progress</a> with members of the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee and the Senate and House education committees. I reminded them that the University of Idaho continues to be an outstanding investment, a public higher education experience that brings return on investment many times over in the lives of students, in research that propels our economy and in engagement that touches every community in Idaho. We have made great progress in enrolling more students and in conducting research of unmatched quality and scale in our state.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> For the coming year, our priorities gained the support of Gov. Otter, which I shared with the Legislature. State investment in adult completion scholarships will encourage nontraditional students to re-enroll. A change in employee compensation will allow us to recruit and retain talented Vandals. The governor supports the exciting <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/research/entities/cafe"" target=""_blank"">Center for Agriculture, Food and the Environment</a> project near Twin Falls. We’re also focusing on building a fourth-year to the program that allows students to complete an <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/engr/programs/cda"" target=""_blank"">undergraduate computer science degree in Coeur d’Alene</a>, and on investing in our <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/cals/research-and-extension"" target=""_blank"">Agricultural Research and Extension Service</a> and other special programs.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> This week was also a chance to watch the full circle of the Vandal experience, from new student to proud alumni. Wednesday night we had a well-attended <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/events/meet-the-vandals/about"" target=""_blank"">“Meet the Vandals”</a> recruiting event. I enjoyed meeting the many young women and men looking to make a decision about where to attend college. They heard from me and our great recruiting team about why UI is the best choice for higher education. I look forward to seeing them on campus next fall.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Thursday night we celebrated at our <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2017-january/012317-silverandgold?utm_source=University+of+Idaho&amp;utm_campaign=cf5c5dcc27-Friday_Letter_2017_01_27&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_18a9cb4835-cf5c5dcc27-"">Ada County Silver and Gold dinner</a>. Two great Vandals were honored: Doug Gross, winner of the Silver and Gold Award, and Howard Foley, our Jim Lyle Award winner. Each exemplifies Vandal success in professional life, and in their commitment to the University of Idaho. I am proud to consider Doug and Howard personal friends, and it was an honor to present them their well-deserved awards.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Seeing the silver and gold around Boise during “Higher Education Week” is always special. Thank you to the Vandals new and not-so-new who helped make it a meaningful week.</p>

2017-02-03,Making Things Happen with Our New Research Facility,"<p></p> 
<p>Dear Friends,</p> 
<p>This week, research and scholarship at UI took a leap forward with the <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/research/entities/iric"" title=""Integrated Research and Innovation Center"">opening of the Integrated Research and Innovation Center (IRIC)</a>. Idaho’s research leader now has a world-class center for interdisciplinary research and discovery in the heart of our Moscow campus. IRIC gives us the ability to take on key research questions in new ways, and it sends a signal about who we are and who we will become. </p> 
<p>IRIC offers cutting-edge space for our outstanding faculty researchers and for undergraduate and graduate students who are gaining hands-on experience. The building is designed to be adaptable for the teams who will rotate in and out, with specialized equipment and flexible laboratory set-ups. This facility embraces the full spectrum of research and scholarship at UI, not just in science, technology and engineering, but also in the social sciences, humanities, and arts. In the words of Vice President for Research and Economic Development Janet Nelson, “Each space is defined by the imagination of the researchers in it.”</p> 
<p>When I began as president, the space where IRIC now stands was an empty field, but the groundwork had been laid for the facility. We were joined for the Tuesday ribbon-cutting by many people who helped make the building a reality, including <a  href=""https://www.facebook.com/uidahopresident/photos/pcb.1294569843933069/1294567937266593/?type=1&amp;theater"" target=""_blank"">Dayaldas Meshri, Ph.D.</a>, a graduate in chemistry and supporter of the building. Meshri studied under professor Jean’ne Shreeve and with professor Malcom Renfrew. He continues a tradition of excellence as a chemist, business leader and philanthropist, and he’s remained a closely connected member of the Vandal family for many years.</p> 
<p>More than 20 teams were accepted to move into IRIC, and research projects have already begun. Ribbon-cutting attendees had a chance to tour the building and see those projects in action, including a new home for research on the potato cyst nematode, ways to prepare communities for wildfire, archaeological studies of Idaho history and culture, health care policy analysis, brain and spinal cord modeling, and much more.</p> 
<p>We have a new growth mindset at the University of Idaho. Our destiny is under our control. We are going to continue to expand our leading research position in the state and beyond. As University Distinguished Professor and the leader of the IRIC-based Center for Modeling Complex Interactions Holly Wichman said during the ceremony, <a  href=""https://www.facebook.com/uidahopresident/photos/pcb.1294569843933069/1294568240599896/?type=3&amp;theater"" target=""_blank"">“Let’s make things happen.”</a></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Every faculty member and student, whether their lab happens to be in IRIC or not, should look at this building as in investment in our very bright future.</p> 
<p>Go Vandals!</p> 
<p>Chuck Staben<br /> President</p>

In March, Mary Beth will join Noel Schultz, professor of electrical engineering and first lady at neighboring Washington State University, and a number of other academic women leaders, for a panel presentation at our biennial <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/diversity/dhr/womens-center/events/womens-leadership-conference"" target=""_blank"">Women’s Leadership Conference</a>. This year’s theme is “Leaned On While Leaning In: Valuing Women’s Invisible Labor.” Organized in partnership with WSU and Lewis-Clark State College, the conference is one of many valuable resources UI has on our campus and as part of statewide and national efforts to promote women’s leadership in the academy and beyond.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/diversity/dhr/womens-center"" target=""_blank"">Women’s Center</a> on campus in Moscow is one of the longest-running, continuously operated campus-based women’s centers in the country. It offers a strong base of support and advocacy for women students, staff and faculty. Director Lysa Salsbury guides the Women’s Center in leading campus education and outreach on women’s and gender issues, serving as a valuable resource for interdisciplinary engagement and activism, and connecting with the community. The center’s annual production of <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/diversity/dhr/womens-center/events/vagina-monologues"" target=""_blank"">“The Vagina Monologues”</a> opens today, Feb. 10, and raises critical funding for <a  href=""http://atvp.org/index.shtml"" target=""_blank"">Alternatives to Violence of the Palouse</a>.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/diversity/dhr/womens-center/athena"" target=""_blank"">Athena</a> is another important internal resource at UI, as our professional association for women, with membership open to all employees. The organization facilitates mentoring, networking, engagement and leadership. A variety of activities include monthly socials, brown bag programs and Women of the Year awards. Athena, led by co-presidents Erin Chapman and Lisa Salsbury, also helps with the Women’s Leadership Conference and partners with the American Council on Education (ACE) to facilitate other professional opportunities for UI women.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> I have recently been proud to join ACE on the <a  href=""http://www.acenet.edu/leadership/programs/Pages/Moving-the-Needle.aspx"" target=""_blank"">“Moving the Needle: Advancing Women in Higher Education Leadership”</a> campaign. The project aims at increasing representation of women in higher education senior leadership. ACE also is building a statewide collaboration with Idaho higher education institutions. I congratulate and thank professor Vanessa Sielert, in our Lionel Hampton School of Music and College of Letters, Arts and Social Sciences, for her leadership in re-energizing this valuable network.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Professional opportunity is a pipeline. At the University of Idaho, I want to ensure that we are seeing our people through all parts of the pipeline, especially as they move toward senior leadership. For faculty and staff members looking for more development opportunities, I encourage them to get involved at the upcoming Women’s Leadership Conference. Our working, learning and living environments are all better served when the work of all our Vandal family members is visible, and when all contributions are valued. </td>

Cohen Sound Achievement Award</a>. The award is part of the U.S. Institute of Theatre Technology’s (USITT) prestigious Awards for Young Designers and Technicians in the Performing Arts. The award recognizes Wright-Ogren for her excellence and creative application of sound in the performing arts. While pursuing her master of fine arts in the College of Letters, Arts and Social Sciences, she has been active in the USITT student chapter and has designed sound for several productions including UI’s productions of “Medea: Her Story” and “The Little Prince,” as well as the Lewiston Civic Theatre’s “The Night of the Iguana.” “Keely’s a natural talent,” said Ann Hoste, chair of UI Theatre Arts. “She weaves together individual ‘sounds’ to create these seamless soundscapes that are deeply evocative but never intrusive. She’s also an incredibly generous artist, always willing to share her expertise with others.” </td>

The team includes assistant professor Crystal Kolden and associate professor Alistair Smith in the UI College of Natural Resources <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/cnr/departments/forest-rangeland-and-fire-sciences"" target=""_blank"">Department of Forest, Rangeland and Fire Sciences</a>; John Abatzoglou, an associate professor in the UI College of Science <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/sci/geography"" target=""_blank"">Department of Geography</a>; and researchers from the University of Tasmania in Australia and South Dakota State University. The research team analyzed 23 million wildfire events around the globe that occurred from 2002-2013. From this database, they focused on the top 478 most intense fire events. Of these, the team found that approximately 30 percent were disastrous fires for humans. The study concludes that there is an urgent need for communities to become more resilient in the face of wildfire. Some of this work will require a cultural shift in the way people think about investing in fire preparedness.<br /> &nbsp; </td>

Reeves, a retired Lieutenant Colonel in the U.S. Army, is the recipient of the Outstanding Public Service Award, our nation's highest award for volunteerism. His appearance is part of a robust series of Black History Month events at UI, and a reminder that our shared national history is often made up of individual and local stories of action and inspiration.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> I met Reginald two years ago in Idaho Falls, and was struck by his story. A 1952 graduate, he came to Idaho from the pre-Civil Rights-era South, having seen historical photos of our diverse classes at UI. Mr. Reeves practiced law for many years in Idaho Falls and volunteers with local soup kitchens, homeless shelters and charities, even starting a prescription-assistance program for geographically isolated veterans. His admittance to the law program and success, at a time when African-Americans were often denied those opportunities, is part of a larger story of advancements toward integration and diversity at UI and in higher education.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Most Americans are familiar with the broader strokes of African-American history, and the roles of leading figures like Martin Luther King Jr., Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass. But Black History Month helps us hear an often under-reported history, engage in a dialogue with each other, and find new understandings. We see how history is shaped by individual people, their battles connected to a broader fight.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> In addition to the presentation by Mr. Reeves, our <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/diversity/dhr/oma/events/black-history"" target=""_blank"">Black History Month programming</a> includes our 14th annual Shades of Black show, seminars, and movie screenings. This year’s movie is “Hidden Figures.” As a space-grant institution, we can appreciate the story of how talented but overlooked African-American women were essential in getting astronaut John Glenn into orbit and safely home again. I’m looking forward to seeing this movie soon with my family.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Thank you to the <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/diversity/dhr/oma"" target=""_blank"">Office of Multicultural Affairs</a>, the <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/law/"" target=""_blank"">College of Law</a>, and the MLK/Black History Month Planning Committee and its many representatives from UI and the community, for putting together an educational and engaging program this month. These events help inform a more fully developed understanding of African-American life and history for all people, all year. It’s a time to honestly examine our shortcomings, and work together to create the best possible campus and world.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> We owe a debt of gratitude to individuals like Reginald Reeves and the countless others who have contributed to a more diverse and connected society. That story shapes individual communities, institutions like the University of Idaho, and adds up to a profound and necessary change for our world. </td>

Over the past year the foundation has generously provided more than $54,000 in scholarship funds, including to students facing emergencies that risked interrupting their education. “We’re honored to be able to offer scholarships to so many deserving students to attend the University of Idaho, and to be able to support the University’s important programs,” said Karen Bilowith, ICF president and CEO. “Our focus is on collective giving and the difference Idahoans can make when we pool our philanthropic resources.” ICF has also generously supported programs such as the North Idaho Technology Outreach, the Auditorium Chamber Music Series Youth Outreach, and the North Idaho Non-profit Resource Center, helping to further the impact of UI’s engagement with students and communities.

The festival, which runs Thursday through Saturday, Feb. 23-25, will bring approximately 4,200 students from 133 schools throughout Idaho, Washington, Oregon and British Columbia, Canada to campus. That’s about 500 more students than in 2016, Jazz Fest Manager Aaron Mayhugh said. “We are so glad that jazz educators, students and fans are excited about this year’s festival,” Mayhugh said. “With a fantastic lineup of free workshops, as well as three nights of amazing jazz performances, this year’s festival is one that you won’t want to miss.” Ticket sales have more than doubled for both Thursday and Saturday nights and sales for Friday night are up by more than 300 seats. Tickets are available through the University of Idaho Ticket Office located in the ASUI-Kibbie Activity Center, by phone at 1-888-8-UIDAHO or online at www.uidaho.edu/ticketoffice. Prices range from $15-$45 per night, and special UI employee, student and youth ticket prices are available.

Pending final American Bar Association approval, a first-year law program will be available in both the Moscow and Boise locations beginning this fall semester. “A first-year program in Boise rounds out the University of Idaho’s options for a dynamic legal education that leads to great opportunities for graduates,” said President Chuck Staben. “We will be able to continue to build on our success at the Idaho Law and Justice Learning Center in Boise and on our long tradition of excellence in legal education.” Previously, all students completed their first-year in Moscow and then could transition to Boise, if desired, for their second and third year. The addition of first-year classes in Boise will make a Juris Doctor degree fully available at either location. </td>

The SBOE approved the next phase of the project at its meeting Wednesday in Boise. “We are thrilled to move forward with this much-anticipated investment at UI,” President Chuck Staben said. “It is proof of our commitment to providing a great experience for our student-athletes, our students and our fans.” The $30 million project is over halfway to its fundraising goal, which includes funding support from students, alumni, friends and corporations. As fundraising continues, UI will move forward securing the architects and builders needed for a signature wood-engineered facility using mass timber construction. Recognizing the importance of the arena, UI students voted to raise the student facilities fee to help support the project. </td>

As we bring the festival back within our School of Music, we’ve made some changes this year: three days of all on-campus workshops and concerts, a competition track for students with a chance to play on the main stage, and new features such as an academic fair for our visiting students. I sat down with Vanessa Sielert, School of Music associate director and associate professor of saxophone and jazz bands, to learn more about the festival from the perspective of a musician, teacher and festival organizer.</em><br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>You’ve taken a leadership role as we bring this festival back within our School of Music. What changes will students notice? What changes will other festivalgoers notice?</strong><br /> The changes that we’ve made to the festival all center around the student experience. We understand from our experiences in the music education field, as well as from students and director feedback, that a competitive format allows students to strive for excellence and personally meaningful opportunities, such as the chance to perform in the evening concerts among world-class artists. We felt strongly that centralizing the festival back on campus would not only allow the visiting students to experience more of our campus community, but would also better engage our current UI students in the festival. We hope that festivalgoers and our current students will notice an increased energy and excitement at this year’s festival.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Going to three nights instead of four makes sense because we have three nights of competition. We’ve changed the format to make all concerts two-and-a-half hours long, ending every night at 10 p.m. <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/class/jazzfest/tickets"" target=""_blank"">All the concerts</a> are in the Kibbie Dome. Prior to that we had them around campus and at different times; we wanted to make it clear and easy for everybody.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>I find this exciting for students and festival attendees. In the past, we have had some student participants who competed to earn a spot on the main stage, and who are now professional artists.</strong><br /> That’s right. As one example, Grace Kelly, a saxophonist, was a student participant and eventually returned to perform in the jazz festival. I also know several performers in the Seattle area who say that being on the main stage at the Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival was the moment they realized that this is what they wanted to do for the rest of their lives.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>What has been the response from our School of Music to handling the festival? What kind of engagement have you seen?</strong><br /> We are all on board! It’s engaged the faculty in a new way. For instance, we’re offering new daytime workshops Friday and Saturday. These workshops will be on a variety of topics, including double-reed instruments, which aren’t traditionally in jazz ensembles. Students who are “doublers,” who play their double-reed instrument in their orchestra or their concert band, but play their saxophone in their jazz band, can have some experience with our world-class faculty on those instruments. There’s a workshop on the jazz rock era. There’s a workshop on breathing. There’s a workshop on giving an audition. There are a variety of workshops that any musician can gain from.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> One of the things we’ve done is that each of our artists coming to the evening concerts is available for a clinic. For Friday and Saturday those clinics are at the dome at noon, and no student will be turned away. That’s a huge positive. Overall, we’re offering many more clinics than in the past.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>What does the 50th anniversary of the Jazz Festival mean for UI?</strong><br /> It means we have a rich tradition of the jazz festival. This started as a one-day, one-room festival with one guest artist, and it’s grown into a nationally recognized festival that’s three days long, with multiple guest artists, with more than 4,000 students participating. It’s really grown into quite the event <span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif; color: #444444;"">—</span> one of the largest festivals in the country. This year, it has grown again in student participation from last year, and <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2017-february/021417-jazzfest"" target=""_blank"">our ticket sales are up</a>. It’s very exciting.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>This year’s festival theme is “Grounded in Tradition. Breaking New Ground.” What does that mean?</strong><br /> Jazz and jazz musicians have always embodied this theme. Jazz music is much about paying tribute to the past while looking forward, pushing boundaries. We wanted the festival to reflect that spirit. We wanted to respect the traditions of the past, respect the core principle of education being primary at the festival, but push it to new levels, experiment, try new things, and break out of the mold.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>You are particularly involved in the “Jazz in Schools” part of the festival. Tell us about that program.</strong><br /> Jazz in Schools started while Lionel Hampton was here, and he was a big proponent of getting out to rural schools and giving students an experience with this American art form. We send musicians out to dozens of schools leading up to the festival. For a lot of elementary students this might be their first experience with live music. We’ve sent four different ensembles out to three or four schools per day in Idaho and Washington, to towns like Lewiston, Pullman, Garfield, Palouse, Moscow, and more.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>What should we know about this year’s lineup of musicians?</strong><br /> Tonight, we have two Benny Goodman quartets. Joseph Doubleday and Felix Peikli will be doing Lionel Hampton-Benny Goodman tunes very similar to what Lionel Hampton and Goodman were doing back in the day. Stefon Harris and Anat Cohen will then play the same piece directly following, but take it in a different direction. It’s a play on our “Grounded in Tradition. Breaking New Ground” theme, and I think it’s a unique thing people will take away from the festival. We will also have New York Voices, a vocal quartet who will put on a fabulous show.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> On Saturday we’ll have the Lionel Hampton Big Band, the core of the group, with our faculty and some professional musicians filling in. Claudio Roditi and Julia Keefe will play as well. And Jason Marsalis of the Marsalis family will play vibraphone with the band. To close out the night we have Esperanza Spalding, a Grammy award winner as “Best New Artist” and a very talented composer, bassist and vocalist.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>Current UI students can buy tickets for only $15 dollars. Are there other ways for students to be involved and see performances?</strong><br /> Absolutely. They can volunteer to be on site at any of the performances, or they can volunteer to drive artists around, or do any number of volunteer opportunities. <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/class/jazzfest/get-involved"" target=""_blank"">It takes 400 volunteers for the festival to run smoothly</a>, so we definitely need and welcome those volunteers. If they volunteer for four hours they get a voucher for a ticket to an evening performance.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> For those who wish to just get a taste of what the festival has to offer without volunteering this year, all daytime activities are free and open to the public. People can come and experience student performances and/or one of our “meet the artist” or educational workshops for free during the day <span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif; color: #444444;"">—</span> before they purchase their tickets to the evening concert.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>There’s a new academic fair this year at the festival. What is the impetus behind that?</strong><br /> We’re having booths from every college just before the young artists contest begins on Saturday. From 3:-4:30 p.m. all the colleges will have a table on the Kibbie Dome floor to the right of the stage. Students can feel free to walk through and learn about many of the colleges. It’s a nice opportunity for students who are here to experience more of our campus and learn more about our school.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>Many of these students have a strong interest in music, but most of these students will come to college and pursue another discipline.</strong><br /> That’s correct. Hopefully, they will continue to play music and be a part of the School of Music in some fashion. Whether they are in the marching band and they’re an engineer, whether they’re in the Vandaleers concert choir and they’re studying biology, that’s up to them. We offer the opportunities for all students to participate and enjoy their lifelong engagement with music.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <em><strong>Thank you, Vanessa. </strong>And thanks also to School of Music and others making this festival possible: Dean Andrew Kersten (CLASS), Torrey Lawrence (School of Music Director), Aaron Mayhugh (Festival Manager), and Vern Sielert (Festival Artistic Advisor). Thank you to our student, faculty and staff volunteers. And thanks to the many donors and sponsors without whom this festival would not be possible.</em> </td>

After discovering that the University of Idaho’s <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/operation-education"" target=""_blank"">Operation Education</a> program provides important transitional support in the educational and personal lives of U.S. military veterans with disabilities, the Taylors made a generous commitment to the program. Established in 2006, Operation Education provides veterans with scholarships, adaptive equipment, tutoring, internships and job placement. “The University of Idaho recognizes that, for many veterans, returning to productive and satisfying lives requires far more than financial assistance,” said Nancy Byers ‘69, current Operation Education advisory board chair and mother, spouse and daughter to U.S. veterans. “Financial assistance such as Don’s is what makes this program and the University of Idaho both special and successful,” said former program advisory board chair David Decker ‘71. “We are very grateful for his generosity and support.” For information on giving to Operation Education, contact Jim Zuba at 208-885-4142 or <a  href=""mailto:jzuba@uidaho.edu"" target=""_blank"">jzuba@uidaho.edu</a>. </td>

Newly admitted students who meet the criteria will be automatically awarded the WUE tuition and fee rate, which is 1.5 times the in-state tuition and fee rate. The award is a savings of more than $11,000 a year over the full out-of-state tuition and fee costs. For new freshmen, WUE criteria include an unweighted GPA of 3.2 or higher from an accredited high school, or a minimum 22 ACT/1020 SAT for home-schooled students or graduates from a non-accredited high school. New transfer students who are residents of Washington or Oregon qualify with a 3.0 transfer GPA or higher. The awards are renewable with a minimum GPA. </td>

Many students come to Vandal country each year from Washington and Oregon. But we heard concerns about cost for many prospective students from our western neighbors. We listened to those concerns, and we are taking action.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Beginning this summer, <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/financial-aid/scholarships/wue"" target=""_blank"">the expanded WUE program</a> means new first-year and transfer students from Washington and Oregon will save $11,000 per year over typical out-of-state tuition. First-year students qualify with a minimum 3.2 GPA from an accredited high school or minimum 22 ACT/1020 SAT for home-schooled students or graduates from a non-accredited high school. Transfer students qualify with a 3.0 or higher GPA. The awards are renewable with the maintenance of a minimum 2.5 GPA. No separate application is necessary <span class=""st"" data-hveid=""41"" data-ved=""0ahUKEwjemuHq2bjSAhUBMGMKHWUcBKQQ4EUIKTAB"">—</span> the WUE rates will be awarded automatically in the application process.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Those guidelines underpin a straightforward and easy-to-understand program. I often hear from parents and students about the complexity of applying for college. I have sent three children of my own on to higher education and also had sometimes frustrating experiences. At UI we have decided that we can and will reduce the barriers to higher education. We recognize the regional need for higher education to provide a pathway for individual success and broadly shared economic prosperity.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The expanded WUE program allows the University of Idaho to enhance its position as a great value among public research universities. For instance, based on academic excellence, affordability and outstanding career outcomes, The Princeton Review just named UI one of its top <a  href=""https://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings/colleges-that-pay-you-back"" target=""_blank"">“Colleges That Pay You Back”</a> <span class=""st"" data-hveid=""41"" data-ved=""0ahUKEwjemuHq2bjSAhUBMGMKHWUcBKQQ4EUIKTAB"">—</span> one of only 200 schools nationwide, and the only one in Idaho. I want to make sure that excellence is affordable and accessible for students across the Northwest.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> We have a lot to offer at the University of Idaho. I invite Washington and Oregon residents to see for themselves what the Vandal experience looks like for their interests, and for their budgets. Visit <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu:80/financial-aid/scholarships/wue"" target=""_blank"">uidaho.edu/wue</a> for detailed WUE information. I think many students and families will find that this enhanced WUE program makes one of the best values in higher education that much more attractive.<br /> &nbsp; </td>

Mike and Katie have made generous annual contributions to the fund since its inception. “We are grateful to Mike for creating this fund for our students,” said Dean Mark Adams. “That support, along with the support of over 60 other individual donors, has provided our students with the valuable practical skills training that is so important to their legal education and future careers.” Many contributions to the endowment have come from former law clerks of Judge McNichols.

In northwestern states — including Idaho, Washington, Oregon, and Montana — humans started about half of all wildfires. The startling numbers show the importance of the governments and citizens of Northwest states working to reduce human-started fires, which often have direct impacts on infrastructure given their tendency to occur in the wildland-urban interface, said <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/sci/geography/people/faculty/jabatzoglou"" target=""_blank"">University of Idaho researcher John Abatzoglou</a>. Abatzoglou, an associate professor of geography in the UI College of Science, worked with project leaders Bethany Bradley of the University of Massachusetts Amherst and Jennifer Balch of the University of Colorado-Boulder on the analysis, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science. “Not all fire is bad, but humans are intentionally and unintentionally adding ignitions to the landscape in areas and seasons when natural ignitions are sparse,” Abatzoglou said. “We can’t easily control how dry fuels get, or lightning — but we do have some control over human-started ignitions.” </td>

Among public colleges and universities in the greater Northwest, only the University of Washington also made the list. The Princeton Review’s methodology includes the use of institutional and student surveys combined with PayScale’s alumni earnings data. Financial aid is an important component of the analysis — UI awarded more than $25 million in financial aid to students in fall 2016. <a  href=""https://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings/colleges-that-pay-you-back/methodology"" target=""_blank"">According to The Princeton Review</a>, “Students who attend these schools don't have to mortgage their futures to pay for their degrees — and we believe they will graduate with great career prospects.” The rankings also reflect student opinions of teaching quality and the accessibility of professors. The Princeton Review concludes, “the 200 we chose as our Colleges That Pay You Back 2017 are, in our opinion, truly the most exceptional in the nation at delivering great academics, affordable cost, and great career foundations. We strongly recommend and salute the colleges we present here for all that they do to help their students with need afford to attend them while delivering an amazing college experience that's worth every penny.” </td>

The University of Idaho is doing its part to train more physicians and prepare students for a wide variety of health-sector careers. Those are areas of <a  href=""https://idahostatejournal.com/opinion/columns/idaho-s-medical-school-wwami-training-the-next-generation-of/article_1ea36729-6822-5ec4-8cd9-c1096ed08fdb.html"" target=""_blank"">critical need</a> for our state and region. Our capacity to deliver those opportunities recently received a boost when the State Board of Education approved a new Bachelor of Science in medical sciences in UI's <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/sci"" target=""_blank"">College of Science</a>.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <a  href=""http://www.idahostatesman.com/opinion/readers-opinion/article61190487.html"" target=""_blank"">Medical education is a pipeline</a> that begins in a key way with the transition to postsecondary education. We wanted to clarify the pathway for high school students to plan for a career as a physician. Often a “pre-med” track supplies coursework necessary for medical school qualification within an existing major, such as biology, chemistry or physics. This is actually the somewhat circuitous route my family <span style=""color: #444444; font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;"">—</span> Mary Beth and our three children <span style=""color: #444444; font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;"">—</span> took to medical school. A medical sciences degree packages those medical school prerequisites within a clearly defined major, with all the benefits of focused advising, waypoints and recognition from medical schools as a stamp of readiness.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Importantly, this new curriculum is appropriate not just for future physicians, but for careers across the burgeoning health care sector. Health care is 20 percent of our nation’s economy, and whether you are a medical writer, health care administrator, lawyer, allied health professional or any other related profession, there are great employment opportunities for rewarding careers that impact health and well-being. According to analysis by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, health care professions can expect 29 percent growth in the next seven years, adding millions of new jobs with high median annual salaries. Those careers can now be launched with a medical sciences degree from the University of Idaho.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Without adding new administrative capacity or funding needs, we have created a strong program that will attract students. We project approximately 50 initial enrollments, a 75-student overall enrollment, and then at least 45 graduates per year. Whether they are going on to jobs in health care <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/academics/wwami/academics/trust-program"" target=""_blank"">i</a><a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/academics/wwami/academics/trust-program"" target=""_blank"">n our rural communities</a> or in our growing urban areas, or taking another step with advancement to medical school, students are going to be well-prepared to shape the future — theirs and ours.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Last year we followed up on important curricular changes to the <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/academics/wwami"" target=""_blank"">Idaho WWAMI program</a> — Idaho’s public medical school, providing access to one of the best medical educations in the country — with growth in the number of slots available to Idahoans in that program. We are moving forward with renovation of our WWAMI facility in Moscow, and looking at ways to increase the number of residencies in Idaho. This medical sciences undergraduate program, for future physicians and health care professionals of all kinds, builds on that success and innovation.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> I’ve seen firsthand the rigor of medical education, as Mary Beth completed her degree, and now my two sons are taking on medical school and our daughter is completing coursework with plans to apply. It takes a lot of commitment to eventually be in a position to make a difference in people’s lives through medicine. I appreciate the State Board’s recognition that this medical science education degree can more effectively bring students into that pipeline and succeed. This medical sciences degree offers the right prescription for our state’s future. </td>

This past fall, the <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/giving/engr"" target=""_blank"">University of Idaho College of Engineering</a> kicked-off the Grand Challenge Scholars Program (GCSP), a national initiative launched by the National Academy of Engineers (NAE) designed to prepare students for solving society’s “grand challenges.” The NAE identified 14 “Grand Challenges of the 21st Century” <span style=""color: #444444; font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;"">—</span> challenges such as securing cyberspace, providing access to clean water and reverse-engineering the brain. College of Engineering Dean Larry Stauffer joined 122 schools nationwide in a commitment to graduating 20 Grand Challenge Scholars per year over the next 10 years. Micron’s support helps students progress through the program and their engineering degree. “This is a great opportunity for Micron to be part of the national movement to change the paradigm in engineering education across the country,” said Vishal Saxena, UI Micron Endowed Professor in Microelectronics. “We are in step with the National Academy’s motivation and vision to prepare engineers to be world changers.

For many Vandals, that’s an opportunity to serve their communities. The <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/student-involvement/volunteer/asb"" target=""_blank"">Alternative Service Break</a> program at UI finds students involved in important projects that lend a helping hand to those in need. That spirit of service makes a difference for families and communities across our region and our world.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> This week 39 Vandals are serving across the Pacific Northwest. They are working with the Oregon Department of Forestry, building river access trails and helping with native plant restoration projects. Another team is in Seattle, doing home repairs in under-resourced neighborhoods. These practical projects offer hands-on experience while strengthening engagement as citizens. I’m glad our neighboring states have a firsthand look at what Idaho Vandals are all about.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Alternative Service Break participants are also doing good work where it is needed here in Idaho. They are in Cottonwood, helping people in our corrections systems with math and language skill development, career planning and money management, as they prepare for a second chance after incarceration. <a  href=""http://www.kmvt.com/content/news/U-of-I-students-serving-Twin-Falls-schools-during-alternative-spring-break-416292423.html"" target=""_blank"">Vandals are also in Twin Falls</a>, connecting with refugees to understand the integration process and offer support and assistance for people who have fled their home countries because of persecution.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The good work accomplished by ASB Vandals doesn’t stop at our nation’s borders, either. International trips take place during winter break. This winter nearly 50 students went to Nicaragua, the Philippines and Ecuador. They helped communities with sustainable energy, sanitation technology and community gardens. That two-week experience made a lasting difference for communities. I have no doubt our Vandals also gained perspective and experience that will inform the choices they make in their education and their lives. They share their insight and growth with our broader UI community when they come back from such trips.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Thanks to the <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/student-involvement/volunteer"" target=""_blank"">Center for Volunteerism and Social Action</a> in our <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/student-involvement"" target=""_blank"">Department of Student Involvement</a> for coordinating these meaningful experiences. And congratulations to the students who get involved. If current or future Vandals are looking to make a difference, I encourage them check out the opportunities available through ASB trips.<br /> <br /> As a university community, we know that we grow stronger together through service. This year the University of Idaho was again named to the <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2016-october/101216-volunteerism"" target=""_blank"">President’s Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll</a>, the highest such honor for schools. Getting involved and giving back is who we are as Vandals. I’m proud to see that spirit of service in action. </td>

The new center will be led by Shirley Luckhart and Ed Lewis, who will move their research programs from UC Davis. They will begin work on the Moscow campus May 15 to create the center as a multidisciplinary collaboration to build a more sustainable human ecosystem through research, teaching and outreach. The pair were recruited to UI by College of Agricultural and Life Sciences Dean Michael Parrella, who worked with them at Davis before he moved to UI in 2016. “They are outstanding scientists and I believe their work here will help transform the University of Idaho’s scientific reach,” Parrella said. “Dr. Luckhart's joint appointment between the College of Science and the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences highlights the connectivity between the two colleges and will move programs forward in both.” </td>

Now, students looking to build their future through the best legal education in Idaho have one more place to start. The <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/law/news/features/2015/idaho-law-and-justice-learning-center"" target=""_blank"">Idaho Law and Justice Learning Center</a>, across the street from the Capitol, Supreme Court and State Bar in the heart of downtown Boise, is now home to a full, three-year Juris Doctor curriculum, complementing the three-year curriculum in Moscow. This is a valuable addition to the legal education landscape in the Northwest.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Last week <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2017-march/031617-collegeoflaw"" target=""_blank"">the American Bar Association awarded the final approval</a> for our Boise first-year curriculum. This follows the <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2017-february/021617-collegeoflaw"" target=""_blank"">State Board of Education’s sign-off</a> on the program in February. We are ready to welcome a class of first-year students this fall. I congratulate those students on choosing a Juris Doctor program renowned for its excellence, its successful outcomes and its affordability.&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;<br /> In the legal, civic and economic center of Idaho, the College of Law's Boise location provides another pathway for learning and professional preparation. Our Boise law program is well-known for its clinics that help community members in tax law, small business law, and economic development, among other areas. UI Law is a leader in externships, helping students find real-world placement experiences and contribute to organizations while earning their degree. In January, National Jurist magazine recognized the college's commitment to service on its annual public service honor roll. That exemplifies the Vandal spirit of service we so often discuss.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Job placement rates in the College of Law are among the highest in the Northwest and alongside Ivy League schools in the top 30 nationwide. Because the degree is so affordable <span style=""color: #444444; font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;"">—</span> much lower in cost than private options in Idaho, and a bargain compared to attending regional public law schools as out-of-state students <span style=""color: #444444; font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;"">—</span> graduates emerge into the job market with low debt and the ability to choose the professional option that is meaningful to them. That combination of excellence and affordability led PreLaw magazine to name UI the <a  href=""http://www.nationaljurist.com/prelaw/best-value-law-schools-2016"" target=""_blank"">No. 8 Best Value</a> in the nation in fall 2016.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Expanding access to our law program comes at little added cost to the state of Idaho, but offers great benefit to our state and students. Whether they are going to practice law or serve in any of the numerous fields and capacities for which a Juris Doctor is great preparation, Vandal law graduates will contribute to the growth, prosperity and reputation of Idaho.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> I’m grateful for our leadership in the College of Law, including Dean Mark L. Adams; our law faculty working to prepare for this expansion; our <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/law/about/law-advisory-council"" target=""_blank"">Law Advisory Council</a> and highly supportive alumni; the Idaho State Board of Education and the American Bar Association. This is a win for students, for legal education and for the state of Idaho. </td>

Through a gift of stock and a future annuity gift, this scholarship endowment not only honors the legacy of a special UI alumna, but will also positively invest in the lives of students in the years to come. Students pursuing a degree in the Colleges of Science or Education, or the Margaret Ritchie School of Family and Consumer Sciences in the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences (CALS), are eligible for support through this endowment. “Scholarships like this impact our ability to retain the best students, by providing them with significant financial support,” said Michael Parrella, dean of CALS. “I, along with the other college deans, am so grateful for this tremendous generosity.” For more information about giving, contact Eric Bennett in the <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/giving/science"" target=""_blank"">College of Science</a> at <a  href=""mailto:ebennett@uidaho.edu"" target=""_blank"">ebennett@uidaho.edu</a>, Marta McClintock in the <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/giving/ed"" target=""_blank"">College of Education</a> at <a  href=""mailto:martam@uidaho.edu"" target=""_blank"">martam@uidaho.edu</a>, or Jen Root in the <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/giving/cals"" target=""_blank"">College of Agricultural and Life Sciences</a> at <a  href=""mailto:jroot@uidaho.edu"" target=""_blank"">jroot@uidaho.edu</a>.<br /> &nbsp; </td>

(Williamson) Wentz, a lifelong Vandal supporter and dedicated educator. Her $25,000 gift to the <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/giving/ed"" target=""_blank"">College of Education</a> established the Shirley A. Wentz Education Scholarship Endowment, supporting future elementary education teachers from Ada and Canyon counties in Idaho. Wentz’s wish was to help future educators enjoy the rewards she received from introducing young readers to the power of books and reading. “It is quite fitting that the 1,500th endowed scholarship would come from Shirley Wentz, lifelong educator and die-hard Vandal,” said Ali Carr-Chellman, dean of UI’s College of Education. “We are so grateful for the help that Shirley’s endowed scholarship provides to our students in the College of Education.” Endowments like the one left by Wentz are invested over the long term to support students, faculty, research and university programs. The 1,500 endowments amount to more than $10.2 million in scholarship and program support distributed each year — and $165 million distributed since 1959. </td>

The study was commissioned by the Idaho Dairymen’s Association and updates a 2009 analysis of how the dairy industry’s workforce impacts communities in Idaho. “Immigration has profound economic and social impacts on communities,” said Priscilla Salant, senior researcher at the McClure Center. “In the case of South Central Idaho, these changes have been largely positive and going on for a generation.” The study found that increasing automation in response to labor shortages and narrow profit margins, along with changing immigration policies and continued integration of immigrants and their children, will influence community well-being in the future. The dairy industry will continue to be a driving force in the region going forward.

In North Idaho, that mission goes hand-in-hand with supporting economic development. Recognizing an opportunity to support this imperative, the Idaho legislature has followed through on an investment in a four-year computer science degree in Coeur d’Alene, funding the fourth year of the program this spring. This investment in our state’s students reflects the belief that the increasingly technology-focused economy of the region will thrive with a stable source of highly skilled and motivated graduates.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The UI Coeur d’Alene computer science program partners with North Idaho College. Students take their first two years toward the degree at NIC, then seamlessly transfer to complete the third- and fourth-year curriculum at the University of Idaho, earning a Bachelor of Science in <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/engr/departments/cs"" target=""_blank"">computer science</a> through our <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/engr"" target=""_blank"">College of Engineering</a>. We have upward of 80 students already in this pipeline and invested in faculty last year to begin the program. Idaho’s investment in a fourth-year program this spring means more teaching resources for fall 2017 to accommodate our students. It also allows the program to seek ABET accreditation, a standard of excellence for computer science programs and an assurance of quality for students and our state.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> An exciting component of the computer science curriculum is the cooperative education track, developed in partnership with the STEM Action Center with support from the STEM legislative caucus. The track emphasizes internships with local industry. Students will divide their program between focused internships with specific educational goals that reinforce coursework and with semesters in the classroom. That means students will graduate with industry applicable skills, on-the-job experience, and a built-in network of employer connections. Cooperative education offers a win-win for students and industry – experience for students on their way to a great job, and support and resources for industries as they innovate and expand.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/degree-finder/computer-science/bs-computer-science"" target=""_blank"">computer science degree</a> is an important enhancement to UI offerings in <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/cda"" target=""_blank"">the Coeur d’Alene area</a>. Our University Research Park in Post Falls supports economic and community development with an emphasis on growth and sustainability. It is home to UI’s Cybersecurity Training and Operations Center, training up to 350 people through 2018 to work in the information technology sector in North Idaho and eastern Washington. We’re connecting in the community with activities such as our robotics workshops, our Dign’IT summer coding camps for young people, and our partnership with Gizmo-CDA, the community makerspace. We continue to <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/cda/academics"" target=""_blank"">offer a range</a> of bachelor’s and advanced degree options, in everything from education to executive MBAs. We’re proud of the success we’ve had, and appreciate the role of businesses, community organizations, and city and state leaders in partnering with UI to make those achievements possible.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> This is an exciting time for Vandal country in North Idaho. Technology is key to a strong economy and a prosperous future for our region, and UI is helping lay the groundwork for that success.<br /> &nbsp; </td>

Baxter ’66 invested in property near Cascade, Idaho. Now a long-time resident of Vermont, Baxter decided to make a gift of this property to the UI to, in his words, “repay my school for the benefits it gave me.” He also wanted to honor two special individuals close to him: his late father, Lawrence H. Baxter, and First Lieutenant Kay Kimura, USMC, a close friend and classmate from Nampa Senior High School who lost his life in Vietnam. “If my gift to the University can keep alive their memories and provide assistance to coming generations of students who seek their own University of Idaho experiences, I will have repaid some small portion of UI’s gift to me,” said Baxter.

The publication is a project sponsored by the UI Office of Undergraduate Research that brings together a team of student writers and photographers to tell the stories of their fellow students and their work in research, scholarship and creative activity. Vandals in Focus features student stories from every college, as well as profiles of faculty mentors. “Hands-on research experiences allow students to develop as scholars and innovators while gaining experience they can apply to life after college,” President Staben said in his introductory message in the report. “Students at UI don’t just receive knowledge — they help unlock and unleash it. I am proud to see that Vandal tradition showcased here.” </td>

It supports students, bolsters academic programs, and enhances research and scholarship. It’s an important way we join in the shared enterprise of shaping a bright future. Today’s event highlights the very human side of that connection.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> For students, the Celebration of Scholarships is a chance to thank donors <span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif; color: #444444;"">—</span> putting a face to the support that plays an important role in their educational experience. For many, meeting a scholarship donor is affirming and motivating. Here’s what we heard from one student, an agribusiness and political science major: “Knowing that someone else believes in my ability makes me treasure learning so much more,” he said. “I think it gives me a responsibility to do my best academically and personally to take full advantage of the opportunities I have been given.”<br /> &nbsp;<br /> For donors, our scholarship celebration provides a window into the stories behind their financial support. Donors are alumni, faculty and staff, and community members. They hear firsthand the appreciation of students. They learn their stories, their interests, their aspirations. The generosity behind their giving becomes less abstract; it’s more than a check, more than a donation. It’s a hand reached out to a fellow member of the Vandal family.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> It’s difficult singling out a particular donor story because so many Vandals are so generous and considerate in their support of students <span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif; color: #444444;"">—</span> after all, the “Inspiring Futures” campaign saw more than 40,000 Vandals offer their contributions, their statements of belief, to this institution. But I’m glad to welcome Peggy and Wayne Thiessen, among many others, to campus for this event. Both graduated from UI; scholarships helped Peggy complete her education, and Wayne points to a graduate fellowship on the way to a master’s degree as assistance that helped him on the path to a great career.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The Thiessens <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/giving/cals/impact-stories/thiessen"" target=""_blank"">have supported UI in many ways</a>, with a scholarship in soil science one part of that legacy. An abiding belief in the ongoing benefits of giving back drives their giving <span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif; color: #444444;"">—</span> a “pay it forward” mindset. “We’re one or two generations away from those students, and it’s a unique opportunity for us to get to know them,” Wayne said.<br /> <br /> “We believe that students are the future,” Peggy added. “Helping them be the best prepared that they can be is a wise investment in the future for our country, for everybody.”<br /> &nbsp;<br /> We’re grateful for the support of the Thiessens and the many people who make the choice to invest in the future of our Vandal students. Here’s what another student, a psychology major, told the donors who supported her scholarship: “Without your help, my dreams would be just that, a dream,” she said. “You have helped make my dream a reality, and I am extremely grateful.”<br /> <br /> Thank you to all the Vandal family members who have reached out their hands to invest in those dreams, and to the students who are taking the initiative to pull themselves up to a bright future.<br /> &nbsp; </td>

They believe in opening doors to science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) and, through the Ferenc Family Foundation of Brooklyn, have made a generous gift to University of Idaho’s STEM Access program. STEM Access is one of seven TRiO projects funded at the College of Education; it connects students from the Lewis-Clark Valley to a path that supports high school efforts and leads to college, especially in the areas of STEM. Kyra Ferenc, a Vandal alumna and former educator who believes in encouraging a love of learning and critical thinking, chose to invest in the program after seeing the passion and enthusiasm of the program’s director, Kirsten LaPaglia. The donation to STEM Access will help further the education and foster excitement in youth who might not otherwise have an opportunity to explore higher education.

The concert, scheduled for 8:30 p.m. Sunday, April 9, is the Vandaleers’ second at Carnegie Hall. Their first performance was in 1991. “For musicians, an opportunity to perform on the historic and acoustically vibrant stage of Carnegie Hall is a great achievement that we all dream of,” said Michael Murphy, director of choral activities and associate professor of music in the UI’s Lionel Hampton School of Music. “The Vandaleers will have the honor to perform a solo concert that will show a mastery of a variety of music.”&nbsp;At the concert, the Vandaleers will feature a varied repertoire of songs from the United States, Sweden, Norway, France, Germany and Haiti. The Vandaleers are traveling to New York as their 2017 annual tour destination. Since Murphy’s arrival as director in 2008, Vandaleers tours have included trips throughout the Northwest and Europe. </td>

This spring we are pleased with the investments Gov. Otter and the Idaho Legislature have made in the excellence of our programs and facilities. A number of projects bear special mention:<br /> &nbsp; 
                     <ul> 
                      <li style=""text-size-adjust: 100%;""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/cda/news-events/featured-stories/cda"" target=""_blank"">Fourth-year computer science degree in Coeur d’Alene</a>. As described in a recent Friday Letter, this partnership with North Idaho College allows students to complete all four years of a computer science degree in Coeur d’Alene. This is an investment in students who want to find a place in the increasingly technology-focused economy of North Idaho.</li> 
                      <li style=""text-size-adjust: 100%;""><a  href=""https://www.lib.uidaho.edu//"" target=""_blank"">UI Library investment</a>: The legislature supported significant new funding for the University of Idaho Library. This will allow us to add two full-time positions and make other needed technology improvements. Our Library is a hub for student academic work and for research and scholarship, and for the development of new ideas and solutions that benefit society. Expanding our Library’s capacity means enhancing a valuable resource for our university community <span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif; color: #444444;"">—</span> and our state.</li> 
                      <li style=""text-size-adjust: 100%;"">Change in Employee Compensation. A 3 percent compensation increase approved by the legislature means the university will keep pace in our ability to recruit and retain talented faculty and staff. We must remain competitive in order to serve students and the state with our best teaching, research and scholarship, and outreach.</li> 
                     </ul> &nbsp;<br /> Two investments from the Permanent Building Fund also stand out: 
                     <ul> 
                      <li style=""text-size-adjust: 100%;""><a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/research/entities/cafe"" target=""_blank"">The Center for Agrculture, Food and the Environment (CAFE)</a>. A $10 million appropriation will help the University of Idaho create a new center for research and education connected to food production and processing. We will have project details soon. This is an exciting project that supports the growth and increased sustainability of key Idaho industries, such as dairy and processing.</li> 
                      <li style=""text-size-adjust: 100%;"">Idaho WWAMI building renovation. The <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/academics/wwami"" target=""_blank"">Idaho WWAMI program</a> <span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif; color: #444444;"">—</span> our state’s medical education partnership with the top-ranked University of Washington School of Medicine <span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif; color: #444444;"">—</span> has doubled in student size over the past five years. Permanent Building Fund support will allow us to renovate the Idaho WWAMI building on our Moscow campus and add clinical and anatomy laboratory space.</li> 
                     </ul> &nbsp;<br /> Several other budgetary items also are important: continued support of the Agricultural Research and Extension System; our Idaho Geological Survey and Forest Utilization Research programs; and maintenance and operations costs for facilities. The Idaho WWAMI program will also see important funding to continue preparing the highly skilled medical practitioners of the future <span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif; color: #444444;"">—</span> physicians and other professionals who will serve communities right here in Idaho.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> We appreciate the support of the governor and the legislature this session. Investment in the state’s land-grant research university pays off in a better-prepared, more prosperous Idaho for us all. </td>

Jim was a new assistant professor in the College of Natural Resources, and Dawn was pursuing a teaching certificate to complement her master’s degree and interest in environmental education. Now, almost 41 years and 35 years of cumulative giving later, Jim, professor emeritus in CNR and a freelance writer, and Dawn, local business owner and longtime chair of the Moscow school district’s Board of Trustees, continue their loyal support of UI and Idaho education. “A person ought to be supportive of the institution that supported him and so many students over the years,” Jim said. “Education is the foundation of a strong nation.” The Fazios have championed a wide variety of university initiatives — from the Douglas L. Gilbert Scholarship that supports conservation communication, to the Library Dean’s Excellence Renovation Fund that resulted in a group study room dedication in their name. “Jim and Dawn have contributed to bettering the lives of so many students and faculty in their 43-year association with the UI,” said Nick Sanyal, colleague and professor in CNR.

The list focused primarily on job placement ratings — the number of graduates who are employed 10 years after their degree. The University of Idaho earned the highest job-placement ranking of institutions in the state by virtue of its 88 percent rating. According to Zippia, “Not all schools are equal in this, and some colleges are vastly more supportive of their students’ post-graduation concerns than others.” The ranking system was based on data drawn from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, or IPEDS. The ranking also highlights the earnings by Vandal graduates — the top earnings among graduates of any public institution in the state, according to the <a  href=""https://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report/best-schools-by-state/bachelors/idaho"" target=""_blank"">2016-2017 PayScale College Salary Report</a>. </td>

But more innocuous natural resources, like rivers and streams, contribute as well. A <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2017-april/041017-greenhousegases"" target=""_blank"">research team led by the University of Idaho</a> has found that the form and structure of rivers and streams is an important factor in greenhouse gas emissions — and small rivers produce more than big ones. Civil engineering Associate Professor Daniele Tonina and postdoctoral researcher Alessandra Marzadri at the University of Idaho, along with their partners at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana and the University of Trento in Trento, Italy, have used these findings to develop a new model to predict emissions at a global level. Their work was published in&nbsp;the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. “We developed a model that can be used at large continental and even global scale,” Tonina said. “The new model provides the needed feedback to help quantify human impact on climate change at the global scale, and it could be used by agencies to provide scientific basis and data to help climate-related decisions in different parts of the world.” </td>

                            Many of you may be aware of an explosion that occurred late Thursday on our Moscow campus. I want to be sure you know about the incident and how we are responding.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
At 9:52 Thursday, students from the Northwest Organization for Rocket Engineering, a student club, were testing experimental fuel in a parking lot near the University of Idaho's Steam Plant. The fuel exploded and four students were injured and taken to Gritman Medical Center. As of Friday morning, all are out of surgery and in recovery. We wish the injured students a full recovery, and I hope you will keep them in your thoughts.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The university released two Vandal Alerts to our campus community about the incident while emergency responders addressed the situation. <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2017-april/041417-explosion"" target=""_blank"" style=""mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Arial, Calibri, sans-serif;color: #b18e5f;font-weight: normal;text-decoration: underline;"">Two news releases</a> and an internal UI memo have been issued, and we held a news conference last night and first thing this morning. We do not have all the details of the incident to share at this point, but we will share them with media as they become available, within certain guidelines for student privacy.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I am extremely grateful for the fast response of our emergency responders from law enforcement, fire department, emergency services and other authorities. We will conduct a thorough review of the incident. Law enforcement investigators are still gathering details at this preliminary point.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Student safety is paramount at the University of Idaho. Thank you for your thoughts for our injured Vandals.

These dedicated professionals are the primary reason UI delivers a transformative educational experience. They are the key to UI’s leadership in great outcomes for graduates, as well as for innovation and discovery that makes an impact across our state and world. As we approach the close of our academic year, I want to congratulate our faculty and staff and highlight their excellence.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Next week at our <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/faculty-staff/excellence-awards"" target=""_blank"">University Excellence Awards</a> we are proud to present two UI professors with our highest faculty honor — the rank of University Distinguished Professor. <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/class/english/graduate/mfa-creative-writing/mfa-faculty/kim-barnes"" target=""_blank"">Kim Barnes</a>, professor of creative writing in our English department, joined UI in 1986. An acclaimed author of three novels and two memoirs, including the Pulitzer Prize-nominated “In the Wilderness: Coming of Age in an Unknown Country,” she is also a committed teacher who exemplifies the excellence of our <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/class/english/graduate/mfa-creative-writing"" target=""_blank"">creative writing program</a>. <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/engr/departments/ece/our-people/faculty/brian-johnson"" target=""_blank"">Brian K. Johnson</a>, Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories Endowed Chair in Power Engineering, has been a Vandal since 1992. He is a talented researcher, internationally recognized in the field of <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/engr/departments/ece"" target=""_blank"">power engineering</a>, and he is as dedicated to mentoring our students as he is to his field. Our Distinguished Professors have gone above and beyond in exemplifying the Vandal traditions of excellence in their fields, service to students and commitment to a caring community.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> One example of our many deserving staff honorees is Jesse Martinez, recipient of our Arthur Maxwell Taylor Excellence in Diversity Award. Jesse first came to UI as a participant in the <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/diversity/dhr/college-assistance-migrant-program"" target=""_blank"">College Assistance Migratory Program (CAMP)</a>. Jesse came full circle to lead recruiting and to serve as associate director for CAMP, which helps students from rural and farmworker backgrounds succeed at UI. He now leads our <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/diversity/dhr/oma"" target=""_blank"">Office of Multicultural Affairs</a> and also serves on UI’s Latino Advisory Council and Diversity Council.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Next Wednesday, I’m pleased to attend our <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/faculty-staff/staff-council/staff-awards"" target=""_blank"">Staff Awards Luncheon</a>, honoring our outstanding staff members who contribute to the programs and essential functions of our university. We also celebrate the staff who have retired after long service to UI, in many cases more than 30 years. Many staff have also contributed to an endowment to support aspiring Vandals with scholarships <span class=""tgc"" style=""font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;"">—</span> a “pay it forward” approach to support the next generation of Vandals. The passion of our staff is one of the university’s greatest assets.<br /> <br /> Faculty and staff may enter higher education for many reasons, but people stay in this profession because they care. They want the best for students and for their university. Students and families looking to understand who we are and what we do at the university will find few better examples than these faculty and staff honorees. </td>

John established the Vernon Burlison Memorial Fund in 1997 in memory of his father, a professor emeritus in the College of Natural Resources. The fund offers scholarship and educational programming support for human and social justice issues, as well as underrepresented communities at the University of Idaho. “These resources are dedicated to making a difference in education and broaden understanding by bringing diverse and controversial ideas to the campus community,” said John Burlison. In addition to more than doubling his annual contribution, John also gave a generous current use gift this year — significantly increasing his giving for key resources in the name of his father. “John’s vision and support make a permanent difference for the LGBTQA community,” said Julia Keleher, director of the <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/diversity/dhr/lgbtqa"" target=""_blank"">LGBTQA Office</a>.

An international team of researchers, including Tim Bartholomaus, an assistant professor of geography in the UI College of Science, <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2017-april/041717-glaciers"" target=""_blank"">have found that the glaciers’ shapes influence how quickly they thin and melt</a> — allowing them to identify which glaciers are most likely to contribute to sea level rise. The Greenland Ice Sheet is the second-largest ice sheet on Earth and has been losing mass for decades, a trend scientists have linked to a warming climate. However, the mass change experienced by individual coastal glaciers, which flow out from the ice sheet and into the ocean, is highly variable. This makes predicting the ice sheet’s impact on future sea-level rise difficult. “The approach we demonstrate here allows us to identify which outlet glaciers are not yet changing rapidly, but might,” Bartholomaus said. “With that knowledge, we can anticipate potential sea-level rise and set up the observational campaigns in advance to understand these glacier changes.” This new knowledge of glacier melt also will help scientists refine the models used to predict sea-level rise. </td>

This unique student group based in our College of Engineering recently returned from the SAE Clean Snowmobile Challenge in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. The students built a snowmobile modified for efficiency, decibel level and performance, completing a challenging 100-mile Endurance Run and coming home to Idaho with awards for Best Value and Best Acceleration. It’s one of the many exciting student-led projects you’ll find at our annual <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/engr/events/expo"" target=""_blank"">Engineering Design Expo</a>.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The longest-running student engineering expo of its kind in the Northwest, the Engineering Design Expo showcases the outstanding innovation and hands-on design work of our College of Engineering students. More than 275 University of Idaho engineering students participate with 40 technical presentations and 60 booth presentations. It’s a chance for graduating seniors to show off their <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/engr/events/expo/capstone"" target=""_blank"">capstone projects</a> in this hands-on degree program. Judges drawn from the ranks of important regional employers offer constructive criticism and feedback, and students also gain a sense of that connection to rewarding careers.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The Expo brings the Vandal engineering students of the future to campus. More than 500 K-12 students and students from North Idaho College and the College of Western Idaho will see firsthand what an <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/engr/events/expo/projects"" target=""_blank"">exciting and practical educational experience</a> looks like. Students are taking on innovative and thought-provoking work in everything from 3D metal printing to downtown Boise infrastructure to high-altitude balloon launches to flywheel energy storage. The applications for engineering are nearly limitless. I can’t wait for our prospective students to see the work and start imagining their projects as Vandals.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Engineering has long been a strength at the University of Idaho. We’ve gained a prominent reputation among our peers, among nationally known companies, and among up-and-coming organizations and ventures. UI was an early adopter and is now one of more than 100 institutions nationwide taking part in the National Academy of Engineering Grand Challenges Scholars Program, focusing on important areas, including one in which UI is very strong, cybersecurity. At Expo this year we have the honor of <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/engr/events/expo/keynote"" target=""_blank"">welcoming Brent Stacey</a>, a strategic advisor for the Idaho National Laboratory’s National and Homeland Security mission. This is an up-close window into the complex and vital task of protecting our energy infrastructure, in part through assuring cybersecurity.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Whether they want to <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/giving/engr/college-priorities/clean-snowmobile-team"" target=""_blank"">build a better snowmobile</a> <span class=""_Tgc"">—</span> check out the <a  href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLMV6TKSK14&amp;feature=youtu.be"" target=""_blank"">video below</a> to see some of that work in action, and think about joining up with the team, even if you’re not an engineering student <span class=""_Tgc"">—</span> or work in energy or water or any number of rewarding pursuits, Vandal engineers are in demand. They’ll be on the front lines of creating a sustainable, secure, healthier world we all can enjoy. </td>

The Jan and Dale Welch College of Engineering Scholarship will provide opportunities for high school graduates pursuing undergraduate engineering degrees. The Welches also provided resources for critical facility and equipment upgrades within the Department of Civil Engineering. The third portion goes to the Vandal Scholarship Fund and Athletics. Both from Boise, Jan and Dale met while pursuing degrees in Civil Engineering. Jan is now President of Stapley Engineering and Dale is former Engineering Leader for Idaho Power. With daughters Laura ’10 and Lise ’18 joining them in the Vandal family, Jan and Dale have been well served by their UI education and are passionate about supporting Idahoans interested in engineering careers. The College of Engineering is proud and grateful to claim Jan and Dale Welch as valued alumni and, with this estate gift, members of the Heritage Society.

This letter can’t capture the full range of ambition, creativity and dedication you’ll find among our nearly 12,000 students. But a few examples speak to <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/academic-affairs/distinguished-scholarships/recent-scholarship-recipients"" target=""_blank"">the energy and excellence</a> you’ll find at our great public research university.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> This year, UI has <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2017-march/032717-nsfrecipients"" target=""_blank"">three recipients of the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship</a>, highly coveted awards that facilitate advanced studies. Fewer than 2,000 NSF Graduate Research Fellowships are awarded each year. From Potlatch, Idaho, materials science and engineering student Isaac Curtis will use his award to begin a doctorate at UI. Benjamin Anzis of Marshalltown, Iowa, studying mathematics in our College of Science and already a Goldwater Scholar, plans to pursue his doctorate in algebraic geometry. Emily White, from Hawthorne, California, is a graduate student working on a doctorate in geology. Combined with six honorable mentions for this award, UI has had a significant presence in these awards for a university of our size <span class=""_Tgc"">—</span> testament to our students, our faculty mentors, and our program staff who all contribute to these opportunities.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Sponsored by the U.S. State Department and awarded to fewer than 3,000 students each year, the <a  href=""https://www.iie.org/programs/gilman-scholarship-program"" target=""_blank"">Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholarship</a> facilitates international scholarships and internships. This spring Casandra Clements, an elementary education major and a junior from Nampa, received a Gilman award to spend the semester in Verona, Italy, through the University Studies Abroad Consortium. Emma Scott, a senior majoring in anthropology from Texas, received a Gilman scholarship for the summer and will take part in a UI faculty-led program to Ghana, studying community, culture and musical traditions.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> I want to also congratulate <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2017-april/050417-fulbrights"" target=""_blank"">two Fulbright U.S. Student Award winners</a>. Our two recipients, Amaya Amigo and Mary Ortman, are actually recent graduates. Amigo was selected for a master in public administration program at SDA Bocconi in Italy. Ortman was selected for an English teaching assistantship in Croatia. A Fulbright is an impressive award that open doors on a resum&eacute;, but I am sure our Vandals are just as excited about the experiences they’ll have and the impact they will make.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Our Vandals have excelled in service and community-building, too. Through our <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/student-involvement/volunteer/asb"" target=""_blank"">Alternative Service Break program</a>, dozens of students volunteered overseas in places like Ecuador and The Philippines. More Vandals spent spring break on ASB trips in Oregon, in Washington, and right here in Idaho. I joined our new freshmen last fall in the <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/student-involvement/volunteer/service/sync"" target=""_blank"">Serving Your New Community (SYNC)</a> day of action, a kick-off to a Vandal career filled with volunteerism. That spirit infuses the activities calendar of our fraternity and sorority system, too. It’s a university-wide commitment that has earned UI a perennial spot on the <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2016-october/101216-volunteerism"" target=""_blank"">President’s Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll</a>, the highest such distinction in the country.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Whether in the classroom, in research and scholarship settings, or in the community, our Vandals have continued to shine. Congratulations to our students for fulfilling and renewing our tradition of excellence. </td>

Her own experience in the UI marching band informs Freeman’s understanding of the critical role of scholarships in supporting successful student-athletes and ensuring healthy university athletic programs. Vandal sports have earned 24 conference championship titles since 2010, and the program had 198 student-athletes with grade-point averages of 3.0 or better for the 2016 calendar year. A recent UI Law School graduate and current deputy prosecuting attorney in the Civil Division of the Ada County Prosecutor’s Office, Freeman now supports students through the VSF scholarship as she was once supported. Her vehicle for giving? The #VSF360 program. Launched in January 2017, the goal of the #VSF360 campaign is to engage 360 new Vandal Scholarship Fund donors, attracting first-time donors and young alumni to begin building a lifelong legacy.

That belief led Kempthorne to enroll as a pre-med major at the University of Idaho in the 1970s, though he switched his major to political science, and earned his bachelor’s degree from what is now the College of Letters, Arts and Social Sciences (CLASS) in 1975. This May, Kempthorne will return to UI and finally receive the title “doctor”: The university has <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/class/politics-and-philosophy/news-and-events/kempthorne"" target=""_blank"">awarded Kempthorne an Honorary Doctor of Administrative Science</a>. Kempthorne was nominated to be the 49th Secretary of the Interior in 2006 by President George W. Bush and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. In 2009, he stepped down from the Department of Interior and began a new phase of his career as president and CEO of the American Council of Life Insurers (ACLI) in 2010. He will receive the honor during the commencement ceremony May 13 in Moscow. </td>

At UI commencements across the state this spring, I have had the chance to congratulate our talented and hard-working Vandals. This spring, UI has <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2017-april/042517-moscowcommencement"" target=""_blank"">added nearly 1,500 graduates</a> to our Vandal family.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Among those graduates are Reinaldo Gil Zambrano, Robert Stewart and Aly Mendiola:<br /> &nbsp;<br /> One brisk Saturday last October, I sat at the wheel of a small steamroller. Graduate student Reinaldo Gil Zambrano — who will receive his Master of Fine Arts on Saturday — put together a <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/caa/programs/art-design/featured-stories/steamroller"" target=""_blank"">printmaking showcase</a> that had artists from UI and several regional universities taking large, inked wood blocks, stretching colorful tapestry across them, and adhering the print with a steamroller. The resulting beautiful and unique artwork was a special exhibit of the talent and creativity of our Vandals. Our Vandal family includes students from nearly 80 countries, including Reinaldo, a native of Venezuela. <a  href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyT1gP-1dE8&feature=youtu.be"" target=""_blank"">Check out the video</a> about Reinaldo’s project at the bottom of the page, and join me in wishing him well as he steams his way to new challenges in the art world.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> In April, I had the chance to visit our Engineering Design Expo. Surveying the seniors’ capstone projects, I connected with <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/engr/news/features/robert-stewart"" target=""_blank"">computer science graduate Robert Stewart</a>, one of many engineering students whose Vandal experience is a springboard to exciting career opportunities. Now 19 years old, Robert had designed and launched his first app on the Apple App Store by age 11. At UI, the National Merit Scholar has helped our team prepare for the DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge, interned at Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories and at Apple, and is on his way to a job opportunity with Apple. I have no doubt we’ll see more from Robert, maybe without knowing it, as we use our phones or another life-changing piece of technology.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Let me give you one more example of the interesting paths our students take. I haven’t personally met <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/class/soc-anthro/students-and-alumni/aly"" target=""_blank"">graduating senior Aly Mendiola</a>, but her Vandal experience represents another important side of UI life. A sociology major from Boise, Aly has demonstrated a strong commitment to volunteering in the community. She’s worked extensively with a local food bank and through the Center for Volunteerism and Social Action. I’m glad this dedicated Vandal is going to stay in state as she goes to graduate school on her path to a career that emphasizes serving others.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Whether they are graduating in art, engineering, social work, or any number of disciplines from law to landscape architecture, I’m impressed every spring by the spirit and skills of our Vandal graduates. Thank you to the many alumni and friends who have supported our graduates on their way to success. We can all look forward to what they accomplish next. </td>

Last month, the Idaho Cattle Foundation recommended $65,950 be awarded to support work in beef nutrition and rangeland science across the state. One $20,000 grant will kick off up to $500,000 in matching support from both the Auen Foundation and the H.N. and Frances C. Berger Foundation. This pivotal funding will build an education center at the Nancy M. Cummings Research, Extension and Education Center in Salmon, housing a much-needed large classroom, as well as lab and conference space. “The College of Agricultural and Life Sciences is thankful for the continued relationship and support from the Idaho Cattle Foundation,” said Michael Parrella, dean of the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences (CALS). “These contributions allow us to broaden the impact of our research efforts across the state.” For more information on <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/giving/cals"" target=""_blank"">giving to CALS</a>, contact Eric Billings at 208-885-4038 or <a  href=""mailto:ebillings@uidaho.edu"" target=""_blank"">ebillings@uidaho.edu</a>. </td>

The program is funded through a three-year U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) grant the Women’s Center received in fall 2016. UI joins 13 other campuses that are participants in the Healthy Masculinity Campus Athletics Project (HMCAP), funded through the DOJ’s Office on Violence against Women Campus Technical Assistance and Resource Project. As part of the initiative, UI representatives from across campus will attend an intensive three-day training this summer emphasizing athletics’ leadership on social justice issues, and how male student-athletes, coaches and athletic administrators can model the prosocial norms of healthy masculinity to foster healthier and safer campuses. UI will begin implementing the Healthy Masculinity curriculum this fall, as well as develop an action plan that addresses both prevention and response strategies. </td>

David Vobora — former NFL linebacker, Vandal football great, and College of Letters, Arts and Social Sciences alumnus — gave an inspirational address. &quot;Don’t marginalize your own capabilities as a leader,&quot; he said. &quot;Don't take complacency. Don’t rest on your own intelligence or capabilities.&quot; I<span style=""color: #000000;""> c</span>an’t think of a better message to start our academic year.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Convocation is our academic kickoff, but next Friday we can come together for another kind of kickoff as our Vandal soccer team — the reigning Big Sky champions two years running — <a  href=""http://www.govandals.com/news/2017/4/27/womens-soccer-vandals-kickof-20th-season-in-the-kibbie-dome.aspx"" target=""_blank""> takes on Boise State University here in Moscow</a>. Vandal soccer has a new home in the Kibbie Dome, and the indoor field is unique in all of NCAA soccer. I’m excited about continuing the tradition of Vandal soccer success and building a vibrant culture around this team in this venue.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> With the potential for large and loud crowds, the Dome offers a distinct competitive advantage. I hope the Vandal family will join us in Moscow to make the most of that advantage. We will have a free and family-friendly <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/events/idaho-fan-zone"" target=""_blank"">Fan Zone experience</a> starting at 4 p.m. in the west end of the upper Kibbie parking lot with food, music and special giveaways. Join the fun and meet other Vandals — <em>and as a special offer open to Vandals and the broader community, at the pre-soccer Fan Zone you can pick up free tickets to the Aug. 31 football game when the Vandals take on Sacramento State</em>. The first 2,000 attendees will also receive their very own Vandal vuvuzela (say that one 10 times fast…).<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Why the Dome? A couple reasons. With Guy Wicks field prone to flooding, we needed to do something to make sure we never had important games washed away. Our football field was due for replacement, and we saw a chance to do something special. The Kibbie Dome offers a brand-new field, space for crowds, availability of concessions and a vibrant atmosphere. Coach Derek Pittman and our student-athletes on the soccer team are excited about the move and ready to compete for more championships on the turf.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> I hope as many of you as possible join us to see the kick off to that journey. (The match will <a  href=""http://www.govandals.com/sports/2016/7/8/watch-big-sky.aspx"" target=""_blank"">also be live-streamed</a> for those rooting from afar.) Come out and contribute to a fun and festive environment as we take on the squad from down south. Welcome to fall 2017 — see you at the match! </td>

This success would not be possible without the continuing support of Mark Tidd, TitleOne CEO and former UI student-athlete, and the TitleOne Corporation, the presenting sponsor of this signature event for the past five years. Their contribution of $50,000 takes the event to new heights and inspires others to give back. “Receiving an athletic scholarship at the University of Idaho changed my life,” Tidd said. “I wouldn’t have been able to afford to go to school otherwise.” Mark’s commitment means the VSF will continue to change the lives of Vandal student-athletes.

The grant, awarded to Associate Professor F. Marty Ytreberg in the Department of Physics in UI’s College of Science, is among eight projects totaling $41.7 million awarded through the NSF’s Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) Program. Ytreberg’s project, &quot;Using biophysical protein models to map genetic variation to phenotypes,” will use computer simulations, mathematical modeling and experiments to determine how amino acid changes modify the way that proteins interact with other molecules. Ytreberg’s project includes a team of scientists and students at UI, the University of Vermont and Brown University. The results, expected to be released on an ongoing basis beginning in spring 2018, will be shared with the public via interactive animations, a website for dissemination of results and presentations for diverse audiences in all three states.<br /> &nbsp; </td>

Our state’s national research university is poised to deliver on the ambitious <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/provost/strategic-plan"" target=""_blank"">Strategic Plan</a> goals we laid out last year. A united effort from students, faculty and staff, as well as our alumni and friends, is the key to achieving progress.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Our first goal is to “Innovate” — to conduct research, scholarship and creative activity that makes an impact on Idaho and beyond. Among other performance measures, we are ramping up our research expenditures, invention disclosures, and student participation in research and sponsored projects. You may have seen physics professor’s <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2017-august/080317-epscorgrant"" target=""_blank"">Marty Ytreberg’s recent $6 million grant</a> from the National Science Foundation to study amino acids, and you may have heard that we have surpassed $102 million in annual research expenditures. We will keep building on our land-grant strengths and focusing on emerging areas of excellence.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The University of Idaho also seeks to “Engage” with outreach that inspires innovation and improves Idaho. Our impact on Idaho's go-on rate is a key performance measure — how many more students are we bringing in to the life-changing experience of a Vandal education? We gained ground on that goal last year, thanks to programs such as Direct Admissions, and we continue to award <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2017-august/081617-scholarshipawards"" target=""_blank"">more than $25 million annually</a> in financial aid — the most in the state — to help students make college a reality. This fall we’ve focused our <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/research/faculty/find-funding/internal-funding/vandal-ideas-project/2017-vip-recipients"" target=""_blank"">VIP grant project on the “Engage” goal</a>, with innovative projects that connect with communities and promote college-going. By thinking outside the box in policies and practices, we have positioned UI to grow. Every member of our staff, each student, and our loyal alumni can all serve as ambassadors in our effort to improve Idaho’s educational attainment.&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;<br /> We want to bring more students to UI because we believe in our capacity to “Transform” their lives through a unique educational experience. We don’t just want students to attend UI, we want them to graduate and to take their places as engaged, successful citizens. This year our new <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/faculty-staff-news/2017-january/011317-studentsuccessinitiative"" target=""_blank"">Student Success Initiative</a> provides <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/sem/sem-departments"" target=""_blank"">a comprehensive approach</a> to academic advising, student support and Career Services. I am confident we will build on our enrollment, as well as our retention and graduation rates, which already lead among public institutions in Idaho.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Finally, UI must continue to “Cultivate” a diverse and valued community. Multicultural and international students, faculty and staff are part of the history and bright future of this global-facing institution. That emphasis benefits our statewide campus — and our state. We also need to ensure that this institution is a great place to build a career. We’ve implemented a rigorous <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/provost/updates"" target=""_blank"">program prioritization effort</a> to make sure we’re allocating resources to support strategic goals. It’s a challenging process, but increased wages and more support for our teaching assistants are outcomes that will strengthen UI for the long haul.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Alumni and friends have a critical role in the success I’ve described. I ask you to stay informed, stay engaged, and stay motivated to help this institution be its best.<br /> &nbsp; </td>

Today’s medical teaching methods call for flexible, small-group learning spaces wired for current technology requirements. The WWAMI building renovation seamlessly combines the latest technologies in medical learning and discovery with additional space essential for academic and clinical faculty. These critical updates emphasize current educational trends and enhanced patient care techniques. “We are glad to collaborate with the Idaho WWAMI program because it is very important to the care of the residents of our region and the education of great physicians to care for those residents,” said Dr. David Pate, St. Luke’s president and CEO. “St. Luke’s, our staff and our patients have a true stake in retaining physicians with direct experience in Idaho who will go on to practice in vital and needed areas, including primary and rural care.” For more information on supporting the Idaho WWAMI Medical Education Program and partnering with UI, contact Chloe Rambo in Corporate and Foundation Relations at 208-885-7060 or <a  href=""mailto:crambo@uidaho.edu"" target=""_blank"">crambo@uidaho.edu</a>. </td>

The College of Law could not be more proud to be the statewide leader in legal education in Idaho.” Previously, all students completed their first-year in Moscow and then could transition to Boise, if desired, for their second and third year. The addition of first-year classes in Boise makes a Juris Doctor degree fully available at either location. Classes in Boise are held in the&nbsp;Idaho Law and Justice Learning Center&nbsp;(ILJLC), in the renovated historic Ada County Courthouse in the heart of downtown Boise. The ILJLC also houses the Idaho State Law Library and the Idaho Supreme Court’s judicial education offices. It is adjacent to the Idaho Supreme Court, Idaho State&nbsp;Bar&nbsp;and the Capitol Building. </td>

For any parent, it’s a time filled with excitement and pride. You want your child to dive into academic life, take on new challenges, and expand his or her world. That exploration can come with concerns. It’s natural: You want your child to be safe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Let me state clearly up front: No college campus is immune to accidents or unfortunate events. These are large, multifaceted institutions. That said, we work very hard to cultivate a culture of safety, starting from the time students arrive on campus. All new full-time students are required to complete the interactive <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/orientation/think-about-it"" target=""_blank"">“Think About It”</a> orientation, which examines relationships, substance abuse and violence. That bolsters the discussions students have with Student Life leaders on campus.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> We also focus on safety during our annual Safety Week, which starts Sunday, Sept. 10. The week promotes a culture of safety and asks the Vandal family to proactively look out for one another. The annual <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/diversity/dhr/womens-center/events/take-back-the-night"" target=""_blank"">“Take Back the Night”</a> rally, a partnership between the Women's Center and the Violence Prevention Programs at UI, is Sept. 14. Mary Beth is looking forward to attending again and raising awareness about interpersonal violence and support for those affected. The annual Katy Benoit Safety Forum also takes place on Sept. 14.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Our Violence Prevention Programs include the <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/student-affairs/dean-of-students/violence-prevention/green-dot/sign-up"" target=""_blank"">“Green Dot” campaign</a>, which offers bystander intervention training. The <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/vandal-health-education/events/i-got-your-back"" target=""_blank"">“I Got Your Back” campaign</a>, a series of trainings, events and resources, amplifies that message throughout the year: speak out, get involved, look out for one another. Last year the Women's Center was awarded a <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2016-october/101016-womenscentergrant"" target=""_blank"">$300,000 grant</a> from the U.S. Department of Justice for a multi-year <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/diversity/dhr/womens-center/cvpp"" target=""_blank"">Campus Violence Prevention Project</a>; our Vandal Athletics program <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2017-may/050217-womenscenter"" target=""_blank"">is joining that effort</a> to engage male student-athletes, coaches and administrators in addressing interpersonal violence&nbsp; and sexual assault. I am proud of this institution-wide commitment. In addition, this year a number of campus entities — the UI <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/ctc"" target=""_blank"">Counseling &amp; Testing Center</a>, <a  href=""http://www.betathetapiuniversityofidaho.com/"" target=""_blank"">Beta Theta Pi fraternity</a>, <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/campus-recreation"" target=""_blank"">Campus Recreation</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/vandal-health-education"" target=""_blank"">Vandal Health Education</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a  href=""https://orgsync.com/144118/chapter"" target=""_blank"">To Write Love On Her Arms WSU</a> — have come together to host the second annual <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/campus-recreation/events/5k"" target=""_blank"">“We Got Your Back” Suicide Awareness 5K</a> on Sept. 12.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Proactive involvement when others are facing danger or other challenges is central to our approach as a campus community. We look out for each other. We educate ourselves and others. We speak up, we get involved. We are a Vandal family.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Despite our best efforts, we may face a difficult situation. I hope we will approach any problems in the same spirit with which we prepare for safety — as a Vandal family committed to the safety and well-being of each other. That is how we honor the promise we make at move-in day and every day at UI. </td>

Barbara ’85 and Anthony &quot;Tony&quot; Tesnohlidek ’85, surgeon and anesthesiologist, respectively, provided a transformational leadership gift for the <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/academics/wwami"" target=""_blank"">WWAMI medical education program</a> facility near the University of Idaho campus in Moscow. “The WWAMI program is dedicated to providing high-quality instruction,” explained Tony. “We have been practicing medicine in southwestern Idaho for the past 23 years and feel a need to give back to the program that contributed so much to our professional development.” The $7 million WWAMI facility remodel is scheduled for completion in early 2018. The remodel will result in a technology-rich center with updated simulation and anatomy labs that facilitate collaborative learning. “Offering students the best medical education and facilities will ensure these future doctors will be prepared for an exceptional medical experience,&quot; said Jeff Seegmiller, director of the WWAMI Medical Education Program. “We are very grateful to the Tesnohlideks for their generosity and support.” For information on giving to the University of Idaho WWAMI program, contact Jim Zuba at 208-885-4142 or <a  href=""mailto:jzuba@uidaho.edu"" target=""_blank"">jzuba@uidaho.edu</a>. </td>

The annual award recognizes an outstanding member of the library profession who has made significant contributions to their library and communities. “Librarianship is a profession dedicated to helping, educating and assisting people as they navigate an increasingly complex world of data, information and media,” Hunter said. “I love being able to make a difference in people’s lives.” To qualify for ILA’s Librarian of the Year, nominees must have a strong commitment to Idaho libraries; demonstrate leadership qualities in librarianship values, cooperative and collaborative activities; participate in mentoring and in-service training for librarians; and participate in a special library service project. Recent UI Library-specific projects that Hunter participated in include co-managing the library’s $1.3 million first-floor remodel, developing a comprehensive library student worker training program, and the reorganization of library services to support researchers and increase the impact on overall student success at the university. </td>

A three-time Olympic gold medalist comes back to Moscow Saturday as we dedicate the Kristin Armstrong Paradise Path. This new name for a well-loved bicycle path crossing the Moscow campus celebrates a legacy of excellence and offers a reminder to Vandals to always give it your best on the way to the finish line.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> A quick reminder of Kristin Armstrong Savola's story: When the 2016 Summer Olympics rolled around, Kristin didn’t have to compete. She was retired, after all, having already won a pair of gold medals and two world championships in cycling. She has a family. She has philanthropic and professional commitments in the Boise community. But the spirit of competition called, and there she was, back on a bicycle, the oldest racer in the cycling time trials, battling a bloody nose, the rain and a shortened training period to <a  href=""http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2016/aug/10/idaho-grad-kristin-armstrong-wins-gold-in-cycling-/"" target=""_blank"">charge from behind for victory</a>. It was a thrill to see one of our own on the medal stand.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Kristin is a <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/ed/news-and-features/armstrong-bike-path/balance"" target=""_blank"">1995 graduate of the University of Idaho</a>. She was on the UI track team and completed a degree in exercise physiology <span class=""st"">—</span> an example of the diversity of disciplines in our newly renamed College of Education, Health and Human Sciences <span class=""st"">—</span> before starting the Olympic journey that took her to Athens and to gold medals in Beijing, London and Rio.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Last month, Kristin <a  href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/cycling/2017/08/28/kristin-armstrong-joins-usa-cyclings-endurance-program/105056482/"" target=""_blank"">joined the USA Cycling program as an endurance performance director</a>, part of a lifelong commitment to health, well-being and athletic excellence. Kristin has been a loyal and supportive Vandal throughout her post-graduation life, receiving our Distinguished Idahoan award in 2015 and serving as an advisor to the College of Education, Health and Human Sciences. We are so proud to welcome her back.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The Palouse and North Idaho are excellent places for biking. It’s always a great weekend when I have the chance to take the Latah Trail from Moscow to Troy, working to improve my times, even as more practiced riders show me what’s possible. The Bill Chipman Trail out to Pullman is an enjoyable day trip for solo riders, student groups or families. Elsewhere in North Idaho, the Trail of the Coeur d’Alenes and the Route of the Hiawatha Bike Trail offer glimpses of our beautiful state that can’t be found any other way. I’ve had the chance to participate in Ride Idaho several times, too, connecting with fellow Vandals along the way <span class=""st"">—</span> a nice way to get to know people, as well as our land.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> It’s a fitting tribute to that bicycling culture and tradition that we imprint Kristin Armstrong’s name on a part of it. I know many students are looking to explore Idaho on their bicycle. As Vandals, they’re also exploring in a different sense <span class=""st"">—</span> what disciplines they’re excited about, what interests motivate them, what they want to contribute to the world. Seeing the Armstrong name so prominently on campus should be a good reminder to keep exploring <span class=""st"">—</span> to go for the gold.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2017-september/090617-armstrongchange"" target=""_blank"">Join us tomorrow for the dedication</a> with Kristin in the afternoon at the Fan Zone, before we head over to cheer on our undefeated Vandal football team as they take on UNLV in the Dome. See you on there <span class=""st"">—</span> and on the trail!<br /> &nbsp; </td>

The College Assistance Migrant Program (CAMP) program tailored the experience for Hispanic students. That meant a lot to me.” While attending UI, Gonzalez sought activities — ASUI, the Center for Volunteerism, the Movimiento Activista Social student organization, and a study abroad experience in Cuba — that helped her identify her passion for contributing to positive change. She continues to support meaningful student programming as an alumna, choosing to give to the new Weekend ASB initiative sponsored by the Alternative Service Break (ASB) program. Weekend ASB engages students who want to immerse themselves in service, but cannot commit, due to time or financial constraints, to a full winter or spring break trip.

Adding health and human sciences highlights the programs offered by the college outside of teacher education, such as movement sciences, athletic training, tourism, dance, recreation, exercise science, counseling, rehabilitation and community health. Established as an independent unit of the university in 1920, the college serves more than 1,000 students each year in six bachelor’s degree programs, nine master’s degree programs and three doctorate programs. The college is Idaho’s premier institution for teacher preparation, as well as programs that promote a healthy active lifestyle. The College of Education, Health and Human Sciences’ name change further reflects the transformation the college has seen over the past year with the completion of a $19 million renovation to its building. </td>

We try to offer the best information possible about our institution’s combination of academic quality, affordability and unique opportunities. We think UI stands out on those measures; but of course, the president would say that. So third-party sources offer an entry point into objectively comparing institutions and understanding the value each offers.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> This week saw the release of the annual <a  href=""https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/university-of-idaho-1626"" target=""_blank"">U.S. News and World Report rankings, with UI the No. 90 “Top Public School” in the country</a>. UI ranks No. 171 among national universities overall. Our business and engineering programs are singled out for their excellence.<br /> <br /> When looking at rankings, I encourage students and families to look at how the methodology views factors like affordability and access, as well as the actual student experience <span class=""st"">—</span> educational quality, meaningful programs, service and scholarship and professional opportunities. How are outcomes such as graduation rates and alumni earnings considered? Does the ranking system match the institutional mission? For example, the U.S. News and World Report methodology rewards selectivity <span class=""st"">—</span> how many qualified students are turned away. That doesn’t reflect our priorities at UI. As a public institution, we want to offer all qualified students an opportunity to pursue their dreams. We are an excellent institution because we hold the door open.<br /> <br /> UI stands out among its peers in the Washington Monthly rankings: <a  href=""http://washingtonmonthly.com/2017college-guide?ranking=2017-rankings-national-universities"" target=""_blank"">We moved up 17 spots this year to No. 67</a> among national universities. We also made the <a  href=""http://washingtonmonthly.com/2017college-guide?ranking=best-bang-for-the-buck-west-00300c12-756e-4165-9559-f82bbf77fcfd"" target=""_blank"">“Best Bang for Your Buck”</a> list for schools “doing the best jobs of helping non-wealthy students attain marketable degrees at affordable prices.” That emphasis on affordability and results speaks to the heart of our land-grant mission: You can afford to attend, you will graduate and you will succeed after school.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> UI is also one of Money’s <a  href=""http://time.com/money/best-colleges/rankings/best-colleges/"" target=""_blank"">“Best Colleges for Your Money 2017”</a> and its <a  href=""http://time.com/money/4864614/best-college-in-every-state-2017/"" target=""_blank"">“Best College” in Idaho</a> based on “educational quality, affordability and alumni success.” Money also weighed how well institutions help low-income students succeed on their way to the upper-middle class, basically how they “help students achieve the American dream.” We’re proud of that success and will continue to strive to make college an affordable reality for more students.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Money magazine has a high opinion of UI in part because it uses PayScale data to gauge alumni earnings. <a  href=""https://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report"" target=""_blank"">PayScale’s 2017 College Salary Report</a> named UI the <a  href=""https://www.payscale.com/career-news/2017/08/best-4-year-colleges-in-every-state"" target=""_blank"">“Best 4-Year College” in Idaho</a>. Our graduates earned higher mid-career salaries than graduates of any other institution in Idaho <span class=""st"">—</span> an annual average salary of $91,700. UI was the only Idaho institution to rank among the top 400 schools nationwide for graduate earnings, and we compare very well with peers among other national research universities.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Lastly, I hope students and families continue to use the <a  href=""https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/"" target=""_blank"">federal government’s College Scorecard</a> for objective data on key measures, among them average annual cost, graduation success and graduate earnings. Visit the University of Idaho’s listing, and you’ll see a simple black line representing the national average. For each measure, UI is on the correct side of the line <span class=""st"">—</span> below the national average for cost and above it for graduation rates and alumni earnings. The site has a tool to quickly build comparisons between institutions. Try it out <span class=""st"">—</span> I’m confident UI shines in those comparisons.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> As I’ve said before, not all rankings are created equal. Consider the methodology behind rankings. Weigh your own priorities and interests. UI stands out as a superb value in higher education <span class=""st"">—</span> an excellent, national research university education at an affordable price that leads to a great life. Don’t take it from the president <span class=""st"">—</span> find out yourself. </td>

The study will focus on three closely related antelopes that differ considerably in body size: bushbuck, nyala and kudu. In the wild, availability of resources such as food, water and shelter fluctuates constantly. Animals must adjust their behavior in response to changing environmental conditions in order to survive and reproduce. Data gathered during this project will help researchers understand how variation in body size limits animals’ ability to respond to changes in the environment, such as the availability of food or water. While the information gathered will be important for determining the best conservation and management practices in Gorongosa, it could also be useful for understanding North American species of varying sizes, such as deer, elk and moose. </td>

Recipients of the competitive fellowships have their tuition and fees covered by their university during their first years of graduate school (years one to three) and their tuition and fees plus a $60,000 annual salary paid by INL during the last two years of their doctoral research performed at the lab. The program allows INL to integrate students into the laboratory and provides graduate fellows with work on significant projects that will help them fulfill their thesis research requirements. INL gains access to skilled staff, along with the opportunity to build long-term collaborations with universities, increase recruiting opportunities, and interact with a continuous pipeline of students interning and conducting research at the lab. Both the university and INL have the opportunity for joint publications and intellectual property. Graduate fellows were selected in degree fields that closely tie to INL’s three mission areas of innovative nuclear energy solutions, other clean energy options and critical infrastructure. </td>

Idaho’s low college-going rate represents enormous untapped potential — a pool of enterprising talent needed for the state’s growing 21st century economy. We are trying to lower each and every hurdle to get more students to the starting gate of a college education.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The State Board is introducing the next evolution of that effort, the <a  href=""https://nextsteps.idaho.gov/resources/apply-idaho/"" target=""_blank"">Apply Idaho common application</a>. This tool allows students to apply for Idaho public colleges and universities, including UI, through one central pathway. A minimum of information is required from the student at the time of completion, and there are just four simple steps. You don’t have to know your major, and you don’t have to pay an application fee. The program even has a tool to do a quick check for scholarships (UI follows that up with comprehensive scholarship information).<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Apply Idaho builds on the simplicity introduced by the Direct Admissions program. That program lets public high school students know that they are qualified based on their academic achievement and have been admitted. This year's letters to parents and students will soon be arriving in mailboxes, a vote of confidence in our young people, telling them we know they can achieve at the next level because they’ve already shown they are qualified and prepared.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Of course, UI is a multifaceted institution, and students come to us <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/admissions/Apply/transfer"" target=""_blank"">as transfers</a>, as adult learners, as <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/admissions/graduate"" target=""_blank"">graduate students</a>, as <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/financial-aid/scholarships/out-of-state"" target=""_blank"">out-of-state students</a> and as <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/admissions/international"" target=""_blank"">international students</a>. We are a comprehensive, national research university, and we hold the door open for students of all types and from all places and backgrounds, believing that we offer an unparalleled experience and essential preparation for each student. With that context, bringing more Idaho undergraduates to college has been a driving focus, and will continue to be. I hope our <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/alumni/get-involved/vandals-in-partnership/"" target=""_blank"">alumni and friends</a> will continue to get the word out about programs that can impact the future of our young people in Idaho and beyond.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> There is no one silver bullet to bringing more people into the higher education experience. On the level of policy and practices, we have to continue to think critically about our existing ways of doing things, experiment judiciously with new ideas, and wisely implement solutions. We also have to continue to communicate the value of postsecondary education. You’re going to keep hearing me <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/engr/news/features/selso-gallegos"" target=""_blank"">tout success stories</a>, talk about <a  href=""https://www.payscale.com/career-news/2017/08/best-4-year-colleges-in-every-state"" target=""_blank"">return on investment</a>, and advocate for solutions that <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/research/faculty/find-funding/internal-funding/vandal-ideas-project"" target=""_blank"">help Idaho’s higher education pipeline</a>.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Lastly, a word about financial aid, another step future Vandals will need to take. Last year, UI allowed students and families to complete the FAFSA in October to apply for aid for the following fall. We moved our financial aid priority date to December, letting more students learn their scholarship and aid package sooner. We felt then, as we do now, that going to college is a big decision — you should have all the financial facts as early as possible. We are very confident that the facts speak well for UI, based on price and based on the <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/financial-aid/scholarships"" target=""_blank"">$25 million in annual financial aid we award</a> — a life-changing educational experience at a leading research university, for an affordable price.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> That’s a value proposition we truly believe in here at UI. I am glad that the application and admissions process for students to access that excellence now has one more hurdle lowered.<br /> &nbsp; </td>

Tournaments will be held at the 5,300-seat CenturyLink Arena downtown. “Obviously I'm very excited for it to be in Boise because that's where the University of Idaho's biggest alumni base is,” said Don Verlin, UI head men's basketball coach. &nbsp;“I'm just excited for the state of Idaho and the city of Boise that we can be able to host this event.” Women’s basketball coach Jon Newlee said, “There is a huge population of Vandal alumni and fans down there. I know they are just going to come out and support us like crazy.” UI men and women will play a game in Boise this season as well, with a December 21 doubleheader at CenturyLink Arena that sees the women take on Eastern Oregon at 5 p.m. Mountain and the men follow against UC Irvine. The 2018 tournament will take place March 11-16 in Reno to complete that three-year agreement. Idaho is one of three Big Sky schools to have its men's and women's teams earn at least one victory in both seasons the tournament has been in Reno. </td>

Among that array of colleges and universities are 76 who call themselves Eagles, the most common nickname. Another 46 are Tigers, and 40 call themselves Bulldogs. There are 27 Cougars. The horse makes for a popular nickname <span class=""st"">—</span> there are nine Mustangs, five Broncos, and at least a couple Mavericks. But in all of higher education, there is only one Vandals.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> It was nearly 100 years ago that the University of Idaho student-athletes earned the school its nickname. A tour through the Library’s <a  href=""https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/argonaut/index.html"" target=""_blank"">digital archives of historical Argonaut newspapers</a> <span class=""st"">—</span> more than 100 years of issues are available online <span class=""st"">—</span> offers a week-by-week view of how the university found its identity, thanks in large measure to a spirited basketball squad coached by Clarence “Hec” Edmundson. Previously referred to as the “Idaho” team, or sometimes the “Gem Staters” or the “Wrecking Crew,” <a  href=""https://digital.lib.uidaho.edu/cdm/pageflip/collection/argonaut/id/1188/type/singleitem/pftype/pdf"" target=""_blank"">“Vandals” was a new moniker</a> that captured the ferocity and passion of the basketball team’s play.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The special history and traditions of Athletics and the broader university is on display in downtown Moscow this fall in an exhibit at <a  href=""https://www.ci.moscow.id.us/arts/Pages/gallery.aspx"" target=""_blank"">Third Street Gallery</a> called <a  href=""http://inland360.com/school/2017/09/it-wasnt-always-joe-vandal-traditions-showcases-ui-fall-sportsspirt/"" target=""_blank"">“Vandal Traditions.”</a> An assortment of artifacts and explanatory materials bring our history to life in this partnership between the city, Athletics, Lionel Hampton School of Music, <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/cals/family-and-consumer-sciences/teaching-labs/leila-old-historic-costume-collection"" target=""_blank"">Leila Old Historic Costume Collection</a>, and the <a  href=""https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/"" target=""_blank"">Special Collections and Archives</a> at the University of Idaho Library. Visitors to Moscow can check out the exhibit through November, including before home football games (<a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/events/signature-events/homecoming"" target=""_blank"">Homecoming is Oct. 7!</a>). A three-part speaker series accompanies the exhibit and brings these stories to life. Our Library, the state’s largest, is behind so much of our student success and research and scholarship impact <span class=""st"">—</span> I’m proud to see them share their expertise with the public.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Traditions are often living exercises that renew an organization’s sense of self. In Athletics, we’ve embarked on a new tradition of indoor soccer this fall, including a “Kibbie Kickoff” against Boise State that I hope will be an annual event. Our proposed <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/giving/athletics/idaho-arena"" target=""_blank"">standalone arena project for basketball and volleyball</a> continues to gain steam. A new <a  href=""http://www.govandals.com/news/2017/9/6/general-battle-of-the-domes-unveiled.aspx"" target=""_blank"">“Battle of the Domes”</a> is the first multi-sport competition between UI and Idaho State University, with the winner receiving a trophy and a scholarship contribution. Our football team continues to generate excitement and success on the field and in the classroom, leading their conference in team GPA last year, as we head to a future of regional football action in the Big Sky Conference. That will include rivalries with foes like the University of Montana; we'll welcome the Grizzlies to Moscow next year to renew the annual battle for the &quot;Little Brown Stein,&quot; part of an <a  href=""http://www.govandals.com/news/2017/9/28/big-sky-football-schedules-announced.aspx"" target=""_blank"">exciting 2018 football schedule</a>.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Since we earned our nickname, we’ve built a century-long tradition of university-wide excellence. More than 100,000 Vandal alumni have experienced an education that <a  href=""https://www.payscale.com/career-news/2017/08/best-4-year-colleges-in-every-state"" target=""_blank"">leads to rewarding careers</a>. Countless research and scholarship contributions in agriculture, natural resources and the humanities have transformed our economy and the way we live. The university has grown to be a leader in Law, in medical education, and in unique educational initiatives like the McCall Outdoor Science School (MOSS) and the Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival. Joe Vandal has had a lot to cheer on over the years.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> All of us <span class=""st"">—</span> students, faculty, staff, alumni, and friends <span class=""st"">—</span> contribute to that success, and to a growing, vibrant University of Idaho. The one-of-a-kind Vandals will continue to build a bright future for our world.<br /> &nbsp; </td>

With the John and Barbara Foltz CALS Ambassador Endowment, their impact will be felt for generations to come in the <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/cals/about/our-people/ambassadors"" target=""_blank"">CALS Ambassadors program</a>, which provides students an opportunity to gain leadership skills while promoting higher education to high school students. Impacting over 2,000 students through his years teaching in CALS before serving as the Associate Dean of Academic Programs and then Dean of the college, John recently accepted a position as Chair of the Animal Sciences Department at Ohio State University. “We are so grateful for John’s service as Associate Dean and Dean of CALS and for Barbara’s service with the Social Science Research Unit in the Agricultural Economics and Rural Sociology Department, and for the support that they have shown to the ambassador program through their endowment,” said Michael Parrella, CALS Dean. “This fund will enhance our recruitment efforts, promoting the benefits of higher education in the state and beyond.” For more information on how to support this endowment or the <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/giving/cals"" target=""_blank"">College of Agricultural and Life Sciences</a>, contact Jen Root at <a  href=""mailto:jroot@uidaho.edu"" target=""_blank"">jroot@uidaho.edu</a> or 208-885-4087. </td>

Classes hadn’t yet started. Thanks to the Hatch Act, though, a dairy was up and running on campus, part of the just-established Idaho Agricultural Experiment Station. As Rafe Gibbs describes in &quot;Beacon for Mountain and Plain,&quot; while interviewing an applicant for Latin and Greek studies, the president realized he might be able to attach funding to the Hatch Act. Would the professor mind, between his instruction on Homer and Virgil, milking the cows?<br /> &nbsp;<br /> During this year's Homecoming weekend, we're also celebrating Idaho Agriculture or “Ag Days” weekend, and it's the 125th anniversary of the <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/cals/idaho-agricultural-experiment-station"" target=""_blank"">Idaho Agricultural Experiment Station</a>. The IAES is the statewide research division for UI’s agricultural research, conducted at nine research and Extension centers and three affiliated centers. If you live in Idaho, chances are good that there is a hub of innovation and expertise near you.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Our agricultural teaching, research and outreach mission is rooted in the past but squarely aimed at the future. Look at our <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/cals/nuclear-seed-potato-program"" target=""_blank"">nuclear seed potato program</a>, which helps the state of Idaho cultivate its signature tuber while educating and training students for rewarding careers. We’re also working hard on the Center for Agriculture, Food and the Environment (CAFE), which when completed will be the nation’s largest research dairy, at the forefront of research on food production and processing.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Tonight we’re proud to welcome to<a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/cals/celebrating-ag"" target=""_blank""> Celebrating Idaho Agriculture weekend</a> Sonny Ramaswamy, the <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/cals/news-and-events/speaker-series"" target=""_blank"">director of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture</a>, delivering a talk on “Innovations for 21st Century Food Systems.” Our College of Agricultural and Life Sciences has a variety of other events planned, as well as <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/cals/ag-days"" target=""_blank"">workshops for high school students</a>. Of course, we’re all looking forward to the pre-game barbecue, leading up to the homecoming football game.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/events/signature-events/homecoming"" target=""_blank"">Homecoming is an exciting week</a> for students and for alumni. A personal favorite event is the serpentine, which winds across campus on the way to the bonfire, a classic tradition that really shines here at the best residential college in Idaho. We’re also looking forward to the parade and seeing what people come up with for the “Under the Big Top” theme.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> For returning alumni, I know you’ll be struck by what has stayed the same since your college experience, as well as the many ways in which the university is moving forward. In that respect, it’s fitting that agriculture comes together with homecoming this weekend; our agricultural endeavors exemplify the best of our teaching, research and outreach mission, and prove how our past informs our future.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> We still haven’t found a professor to milk the cows while teaching the classics, at least to my knowledge. But we have grown and thrived as a home for agricultural excellence over these 125 years.<br /> &nbsp; </td>

Accomplished professional musicians with a major symphony orchestra, the Baileys honor their family history by generously supporting several family endowments. Most recently, they honored Bruce’s late mother, a 1934 Department of English alumna, through establishing the Mary Axtell Bailey Journalism Scholarship Endowment. “We created this scholarship in our mother’s memory because like others in our family, mom understood the value of hard work and a good education,” Bruce explained. “We want to help make that possible for the next generation because we deeply value the role the humanities and performing arts play in society and higher education.” For more information on <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/giving/class"" target=""_blank"">giving to the College of Letters, Arts and Social Sciences</a>, contact Shyanne Knighten at 208-885-4561 or <a  href=""mailto:sknighten@uidaho.edu"" target=""_blank"">sknighten@uidaho.edu</a>. </td>

That success is detailed in the federal government’s <a  href=""https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/"" target=""_blank"">updated College Scorecard</a>, revealed on Sept. 28. In addition to affordability, student success and alumni earnings, the site contains detailed institutional information about financial aid, academic programs, the student body composition and more. Searching by programs, by name, by size or by location offers a quick-view comparison of institutions. This year’s update adds a more sophisticated “compare” function, allowing users to select institutions from the search results and view a more detailed, highly visual analysis. “The College Scorecard is an objective tool that measures the things students and families care about: affordability, student success, and return on investment after college,” said President Chuck Staben. “We’re very confident that the University of Idaho stands out as an exceptional value – an outstanding education at an affordable price, leading to career success.” </td>

The anniversary is an opportunity to take pride in 100 years of excellence in education, research and statewide outreach. But while we celebrate our past accomplishments, we are also looking toward the future of this vital piece of our land-grant research university mission.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The college is a leader in natural resources education in the West, recently recognized among the top 5 percent of natural resource and conservation colleges. The college partners with industry on educational programs that prepare students to emerge with their degree armed with hands-on experience in their fields. The state’s forests, rangelands and waterways have been well-served by generations of highly skilled and motivated Vandals. We’re happy to welcome many of them back to Moscow this weekend to celebrate “100 Years of Leadership.”<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Research and scholarship are also CNR strengths. Vital research and outreach through the Forest Utilization Research (FUR) Programs includes the <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/cnr/policy-analysis-group"" target=""_blank"">Policy Analysis Group</a>, which provides analysis on natural resource issues; our <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/cnr/center-for-forest-nursery-and-seedling-research"" target=""_blank"">Center for Forest Nursery and Seedling Research</a>, a global leader in native plant regeneration education and research; the <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/cnr/ui-experimental-forest"" target=""_blank"">UI Experimental Forest</a>, which provides a working forest classroom; and the <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/cnr/rangeland-center"" target=""_blank"">UI Rangeland Center</a> collaboration between CNR and the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences, which uses science to find long-term solutions for managing rangelands. Through the college, UI provides unbiased research that helps deliver effective private and public management of our natural resources.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> CNR is also an arm for UI’s outreach mission. One needs look no further than the <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/cnr/mccall-outdoor-science-school/"" target=""_blank"">McCall Outdoor Science School</a> at our McCall Field Campus. To date, over 30,000 K-12 students have now gone through the program, an immersive experience that equips students with a new understanding of ecology and the exciting world of scientific exploration. Those STEM experiences engage curiosity and build character — they can be truly life-changing.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Lastly, CNR has a special connection to <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/giving/athletics/idaho-arena"" target=""_blank"">our Idaho Arena project</a>. Right now in the United States, we have the potential for a breakthrough in mass timber construction – projects that extensively use one or more kinds of engineered wood. Idaho, and the University of Idaho, are positioned to be leaders in this fast-emerging industry, with the arena a milestone in its development. Using mass-timber construction means opportunities for the college to engage partners, to train students in a real-world project, and to study research questions. Before we ever score a basket in the arena, we’ll already have won a major victory in research and economic development in a potentially game-changing Idaho industry.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> That’s an exciting future for UI, and a piece of it belongs to the College of Natural Resources. We appreciate the leadership role of the college throughout a century of teaching, innovation and statewide engagement. Here’s looking forward to the next century.<br /> &nbsp; </td>

Such is the legacy of this CNR professor, who devoted 38 years to sharing his tremendous enthusiasm for teaching with thousands of students. A strong proponent of experiential education and “real life” applications of learning, Fred and his family spent much of their time on the McCall Field Campus; to many, “Fred Johnson” and “summer camp” are synonymous. Fred’s legacy of great teaching lives on through the Fred Johnson Endowment for Teaching Excellence in Forest Resources, which recently reached $60,000 thanks to recent gifts by the Johnson family and fellow supporters. Fred’s advice to students: “Find something you love to do,&nbsp;then&nbsp;do it with passion.” For more information about this endowment or <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/giving/cnr"" target=""_blank"">other opportunities to support CNR</a>, contact Jennifer Farnum at 208-885-5145 or <a  href=""mailto:jfarnum@uidaho.edu"" target=""_blank"">jfarnum@uidaho.edu</a>. </td>

The institute's goal is to spread knowledge about the Chinese language and culture. &quot;As you know, the English language and the Chinese language are two very different languages. The pronunciation is different, the spelling is different and the grammar is different,&quot; Xue (pronounced sh UH eh) said. &quot;There has been, for a very long time, an assumption among the people, particularly among the community around us, that it is very hard to acquire the language.&quot; To combat this assumption, the Confucius Institute holds community Chinese language classes in Moscow, Coeur d'Alene and Boise. In Moscow, the classes consist of two levels of Mandarin, each only $50 for the fall, and a Chinese calligraphy class at only $25. They're held Monday through Thursday in the Moscow Chamber of Commerce office. <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/media-coverage/2017-fall/101017-chineseculture"" target=""_blank""><em>READ MORE</em></a> </td>

Members of the Vandal Marching Band begin moving into formation. They form the iconic letter ‘I,’ set their sunglasses down on the field, and the props begin flashing in a dizzying display of lights. When the band members go on to form the Vandals script, the ‘I’ is still illuminated in the middle of the turf. The crowd erupts in cheers at the unanticipated light show, and then sings along as the UI fight song resonates throughout the Kibbie Dome. This innovative performance is the product of a partnership between the Department of Computer Science in the College of Engineering and UI’s marching band — an effort that began in 2012 when Bob Rinker, associate professor of computer science, and Athletic Band Director Spencer Martin met at the behest of student Josh Armstrong. <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/engr/news/features/sunglasses"" target=""_blank""><em>READ MORE</em></a> </td>

That commitment takes many forms and directions, offering many opportunities for engagement and enrichment. It has been an exciting couple of weeks in U of I efforts to strengthen our public dialogue.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Next Monday we’ll have a lecture from Carol Tavris, co-author of <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/class/general-education/common-read"" target=""_blank"">this year’s Common Read selection, “Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me),”</a> which describes the concept and the dangers of cognitive dissonance, the roles of self-justification in that behavior, and approaches to getting past that. The Common Read unites our university community, including our first-year students, in an intellectual exercise that sets a tone for engagement and inquiry. This year the <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/alumni/get-involved/vandal-book-club"" target=""_blank"">new Vandal Book Club</a> adopted “Mistakes Were Made” as its first book, a nice extension of this program to our alumni. I hope they’ve shared the interest and enthusiasm in this book that our campus community has shown.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> This week we were honored to have <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/class/borah/fall"" target=""_blank"">Nobel Prize laureate Dr. Shirin Ebadi</a> at our annual <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/class/borah"" target=""_blank"">Borah Symposium</a>. Ebadi, the first woman to hold the post of chief magistrate of a court in Tehran, Iran, before the Islamic Revolution, has been a strong voice for human rights and justice in the years following the revolution. Her keynote was a highlight in a robust program that also included presentations by Professor LeRoy Ashby and Scott Shapiro.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Finally, a little over a week ago our annual <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/law/news/bellwood"" target=""_blank"">Sherman J. Bellwood Lecture</a> brought <a  href=""https://www.uiargonaut.com/2017/10/16/nevertheless-i-persisted-anita-hill-discusses-the-importance-of-data-at-ui-bellwood-lecture-wednesday/"" target=""_blank"">Professor Anita Hill to Boise and to Moscow</a>. Many people may remember her launch into the public spotlight at the 1991 Supreme Court confirmation hearings for now-Justice Clarence Thomas. We were proud to host such a thoughtful and spirited examination of the role of evidence and accountability in policy, especially as it applies to issues such as civil rights and harassment.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Exploring ideas, policies and controversies in the public sphere is part of U of I’s commitment to helping our society understand the past, engage with the issues of the day and take on the challenges of tomorrow. Programs such as our Common Read, Borah Symposium and Bellwood Lecture provoke thought, spark dialogue and encourage new perspectives while promoting shared understanding. Engaging in these kind of programs, we grow as citizens and leaders. We develop a fuller appreciation for the challenges and opportunities ahead of us. </td>

As he and a friend from the school’s soccer team made their way through the store, they paused in the television section, where every TV was tuned to the same program: a replay of the Vandals’ December appearance in the Famous Idaho Potato Bowl, a 61–50 win over Colorado State. Sannon, a fifth-year senior, was incredulous as he watched his second touchdown of the day, a 16-yard catch in the game’s third quarter, unfold on dozens of screens. “It’s six months since our bowl game, and they’ve still got it on the TV,” he recalls, still amazed 48 hours later. After playing on one-win teams in 2013 and ’14 and missing almost all of ’15 with an injury, last season was sweet redemption for Sannon, a Florida native of Haitian descent who had never seen snow until Idaho lured him to campus with his only scholarship offer. Finally healthy, he had 303 receiving yards for a Vandals team that tied a program record with nine wins and brought home the school’s first bowl victory in seven seasons.&nbsp;The turnaround Sannon had signed up for four years before was well on its way. This fall,&nbsp;Sannon&nbsp;is Idaho’s leading receiver, and he has one last chance to make a mark before he runs out of eligibility—and his team is run out of FBS ball. <a  href=""https://www.si.com/college-football/2017/10/19/idaho-vandals-sun-belt-fcs-realignment"" target=""_blank"">Read more.</a> </td>

How do build a more vibrant economy and healthier communities? The University of Idaho believes that higher education offers the best pathway for a bright future. That’s why the university has been out in front of efforts to change the state’s college-going culture and promote post-secondary participation for several years. This fall, thanks to a university-wide effort, we have again seen positive results <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2017-october/102517-enrollment"" target=""_blank"">and an increase in enrollment</a>.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Overall enrollment at U of I has grown 2.4 percent for fall 2017, topping 12,000 students for the first time in five years. That increase includes notable gains in key areas, including a 3.9 percent increase in total resident enrollment, a 7.3 percent uptick in <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/admissions/international"" target=""_blank"">international student enrollment</a>, and an increase in underrepresented populations, including Hispanic and Native American student enrollment. International and underrepresented student enrollment are important measures of how our <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/academics/ipo"" target=""_blank"">global research university</a> cultivates a valued and diverse community.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> This fall we’ve also seen a significant, 23 percent increase in participation in dual-credit courses in our K-12 system. College students aren’t born, they are made: We can reach Idaho students with an experience that helps them develop as thinkers and leaders while they are in high school. They emerge <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/news/here-we-have-idaho-magazine/dual-credit"" target=""_blank"">prepared to succeed in college</a>, contributing right away to the classroom culture and using their accumulated credits to graduate on time. The U of I’s commitment to this <a  href=""https://nextsteps.idaho.gov/"" target=""_blank"">statewide priority</a> continues to pay off.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Lastly, a comprehensive understanding of enrollment acknowledges the importance of retention, the rate at which students continue on from year to year toward graduation. This fall our freshman-to-sophomore retention rate stands at 82 percent, a 5 percent gain over last year, on par with the national average and the highest rate among Idaho public institutions. The U of I is continuing to invest in approaches that foster retention <span class=""st"">—</span> such as our <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/news/here-we-have-idaho-magazine/career-services"" target=""_blank"">Student Success Initiative launched in January 2017</a> <span class=""st"">—</span> and success through graduation and into a career.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> An educated citizenry is key to the university’s land-grant mission and to the aspirations of the state of Idaho. Challenges remain in areas such as growing new resident student populations, but the university is well-positioned to take on those challenges, thanks to the hard work of the entire Vandal community, from our teaching ranks to our recruiting teams to our advising staff. That university-wide dedication means that more students from Idaho and beyond come to know the U of I story as one of the best values in higher education <span class=""st"">—</span> a life-changing educational experience, at an affordable price, that prepares learners for lifelong success. </td>

Nels Reese <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2017-october/102317-idahotreasure"" target=""_blank"">with the 2017 Idaho Treasure Award</a>. Awarded by the <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/faculty-staff/uira"" target=""_blank"">UI Retirees Association</a>, the Idaho Treasure Award recognizes retired university faculty and staff and their family members for contributions of leadership and service to the university.&nbsp;A native of Boise, Reese graduated from U of I in 1962 with a bachelor’s degree in architecture. He went on to receive a master’s in urban planning from City College of New York. His resume includes eight years spent in the Army National Guard, five years as art director for Army in Europe magazine while living in Heidelberg Germany, and seven years as director of facilities at U of I. Reese taught architecture at U of I for more than 20 years. His focus was primarily on urban design and planning and he led his students on numerous field trips, including to New York, to see architecture at work. A longtime public servant, Reese was appointed to Moscow’s Planning and Zoning Commission in 1996, a post he still holds today. </td>

But as an I&ntilde;upiaq Eskimo in Alaska, Rogers grew up in classrooms filled with mostly white students and white teachers, and that pride in her language wasn’t always shared. Being discouraged from speaking her native tongue was one of many experiences that spurred her desire to teach music education to Alaska Native students in the villages that make up the 49th state. “Growing up, I didn’t have role models who were Native,” said Rogers, 19, a sophomore music education major in the College of Letters, Arts and Social Sciences (CLASS) at the University of Idaho. She wants to better herself so she can be the best example possible for her fellow indigenous students. Jessica Matsaw has a similar goal. A senior finishing her bachelor’s degree in sociology with a minor in psychology in CLASS, Matsaw wants to take what she’s learned at U of I and apply it as a teacher on the Fort Hall Reservation in southeastern Idaho. Rogers and Matsaw are among a small group of Native American students at UI who are<a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/here-we-have-idaho-magazine/ikeep"" target=""_blank""> learning the best ways to serve Native communities through a cultural lens</a> as part of the <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/ed/resources/ikeep"" target=""_blank"">Indigenous Knowledge for Effective Education Program (IKEEP)</a>, run through the College of Education, Health and Human Sciences (CEHHS). </td>

The main project for UI-HEC is installing a water pump in Carani, Bolivia, which Majors worked on. The group works in partnership with the city to help build the water system. This helps avoid giving a western solution to a South American problem, Erickson said. The team’s goals are to help the community of Carani obtain water closer to their homes, empower them to meet their needs and build together, Erickson said. <a  href=""https://www.uiargonaut.com/2017/10/16/ten-days-in-bolivia-university-of-idaho-students-travel-to-bolivia-to-assist-a-community-in-need-of-water/"" target=""_blank"">Read more.</a> </td>

2015-08-21,An American Dream Institution,"August 21, 2015 	
 <http://www.uiweb.uidaho.edu/creativeservices/pres/friday_letter_head_2014.jpg> 	
Dear Friends,

Today young men and women from all over the world begin their educational journeys as Vandals. At Convocation this morning, our faculty and staff members gather to welcome our incoming freshmen and transfer students. We applaud them for making a momentous decision: By attending UI, they’ve taken a crucial step in achieving their American Dream.

The American Dream is a national ethos of the United States, in which freedom includes the opportunity for prosperity and success, and upward social mobility for children and families – achieved through hard work in a society with few barriers. Over and over again, in the lives of countless students and their families, that dream matures at the University of Idaho. Together with our faculty and staff, I am inspired to work at UI because we help build the future and continue the American Dream <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=4647df556e&e=55d7947efc> . Our incoming students will unlock their potential, discover new interests and absorb different perspectives – building blocks for a personally satisfying and financially stable life.

UI, like other leading, national research universities, provides those building blocks in a very special way. Universities like ours provide real-world research and scholarly experience for students as well as instruction by faculty on the leading edge of their disciplines. The young men and women in the Convocation crowd this morning will have a chance to work directly alongside professors who are recognized experts in their fields. Maybe they’ll help rediscover a piece of Idaho’s heritage <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=888a42477d&e=55d7947efc>  on an archaeology project. Maybe they’ll unlock the key to understanding the next Ebola epidemic <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=f5c9c700bc&e=55d7947efc> . They will all grow as individuals, become experts in their fields, and acquire transferable skills to innovate throughout their lives.

Students pursue those transformative experiences as part of a diverse cohort of students from around the world. At Convocation this morning, students sit beside colleagues from every state in the nation, and from more than 70 countries around the world. Students from big cities study with students from small towns and family farms. A student from Brazil or Saudi Arabia can exchange ideas and forge lifelong friendships with a student from Boise, or Idaho Falls, or Seattle. Students emerge from UI prepared not just with career skills, but with the global understandings they need to compete and collaborate in the 21st century.

We’ll share these ideas with our students this morning. We’ll also share what they can look forward to after graduation, the success with which so many of our alumni, friends and supporters are already familiar. You read the stories, you hear it from your friends, and you experience it in your own life – Vandal alumni do great things. Whether it’s exploring the final frontier <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=a43b35ad64&e=55d7947efc>  of space, reaching lofty heights in public service <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=fa39bb2cbc&e=55d7947efc>  or creating a stronger future for agriculture <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=00fad9a2bc&e=55d7947efc> , Vandals make the world better.

As we begin this exciting new year, I encourage our alumni to be involved at UI. Join an advisory board, or engage with the alumni association <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=c5fc89bf1a&e=55d7947efc> . Reach out to a college or department – or our Career Center <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=ba1663ee60&e=55d7947efc>  – and see how your company or organization can engage students at UI. Talk to young people still making decisions for their future about what your college experience meant to you. Our Vandal family is so important to the success of our university. It’s one key place where we distinguish ourselves from other universities. As Paul Joyce, Dean of Science, puts it, UI is “big enough to matter, and small enough to care.” That care shines through brightly in the passion and commitment of our alumni.

We have big challenges ahead of us. I’m eager to watch this class of freshmen embrace the opportunities inherent in those challenges, and I look forward to seeing them achieve their American Dream through a Vandal education.

Here's the Latest News from the University of Idaho	 

Scholarship Supports International Engineering Opportunities	 
The College of Engineering is grateful to Daniella and Andy Emerson ’97 for providing perpetual support of students through the newly created Emerson International Engineering Scholarship Endowment. Inspired by his own study abroad experience as a student, Andy wanted to provide international leadership opportunities that will prepare students to compete globally and inspire a passion necessary to take on 21st-century challenges. “Our alumni, faculty and corporate partners understand that engineering graduates with international experiences are in demand,” said Dean Stauffer. “For our graduates to become engineering leaders in their fields, it will require a deep understanding and appreciation for how different societies and industries operate around the world.” Andy is the president of MH Solutions, a provider of engineered material handling systems for mining and heavy industry, and serves on the UI Foundation board of directors. For more information on giving to the College of Engineering <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=e73b324080&e=55d7947efc> , contact Mary Lee Ryba at (208) 755-4916 or mryba@uidaho.edu <mailto:mryba@uidaho.edu?subject=Giving%20to%20the%20College%20of%20Engineering> .	 
SEL Gives $2 Million to Establish Endowed Chair	 
Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories, Inc. (SEL) has donated $2 million to the University of Idaho College of Engineering to create an endowed chair position <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=9b8dcd3d61&e=55d7947efc>  in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. “The Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories Chair in Power Engineering” establishes a highly honored academic position that will attract and support distinguished faculty in the field of power engineering and further the college’s mission of excellence in fundamental engineering education with real-world applications. SEL invents, designs and builds digital products and systems that protect power grids around the world. This technology prevents blackouts and enables customers to improve power system reliability, safety and cost. An endowed chair is a distinguished university professorship that is used to attract a preeminent scholar in a specific academic field, in this case power engineering. The enhanced financial support and prestige generated by the endowment will dramatically fuel future innovation in electric power research and teaching.	 
UI Leads National Project to Combat Potato Nematodes	 
The University of Idaho will lead a $3.2 million project to combat microscopic worms <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=ab71063451&e=55d7947efc>  that threaten potato production. The project, which focuses on the pale cyst nematode and golden nematode, relies on university, federal and industry efforts. These nematodes can reduce potato production by up to 80 percent by infecting the plant’s roots, draining energy that would otherwise create tubers. One of the nematode’s worst qualities for farmers is that its cysts or egg clusters can survive up to 30 years in the soil. The $3.2 million grant from the USDA Food Security Challenge Area program is one of only three projects funded nationally this year. The project's research and extension team of eighteen scientists includes six UI faculty members in the areas of nematology, plant pathology, plant molecular biology, Extension, and agricultural economics.

2015-08-28,Foundations for a Safe Campus,"August 28, 2015 	
 <https://gallery.mailchimp.com/e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef/images/78d0092c-6b67-41ab-8113-fb516677185b.jpg> 	
	
Dear Friends, 	
As a father of three college-age children, I’ve had to drop my students off at college three times. That’s a tough experience for any parent — leaving your loved one in a new place, on their own with new people and new experiences. At the University of Idaho, we’re trusted to provide a safe, positive educational experience for students. As I told parents and guardians at Convocation last week, that’s a commitment we take seriously, and we strive to maintain a campus environment that offers each student the chance to learn and grow as individuals and as members of a caring community.
 
UI has been and continues to be a safe campus for all the members of our community. A safe campus environment starts with clear expectations about how students treat one another and what resources and support are available. For the third consecutive year, incoming full-time undergraduates at UI are required to take a “Think About It” <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=cc5ee5ca2e&e=55d7947efc>  course. This interactive program poses realistic scenarios and offers opportunities for guided self-reflection. Focusing on sexual assault, alcohol and drug use, and healthy relationships, this program has accomplished very high completion rates. Now in its third consecutive year of implementation at UI, the program has been updated to include understandings of survivor trauma and keep up with compliance measures in federal regulations.
 
Promotion of campus safety takes center stage soon during the fourth annual Campus Safety Week <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=dc07f9fb44&e=55d7947efc> , September 14-19. A number of partners across campus, including student groups and leaders, will come together for events that promote a safe campus. The “I Got Your Back” campaign highlights Vandals taking care of Vandals. The “Green Dot” program highlights the importance of bystander intervention. This year I’ll proudly attend the “Take Back the Night” rally that raises awareness about sexual assault and violence prevention. Teaching skills, highlighting resources and promoting attitudes, these programs can stay with our students all year.
 
It’s also important that we have the infrastructure that promotes a safe campus. Throughout the fall and spring we’ll be installing additional security cameras in our common areas and in access points to key buildings. This is a project we’ve made a special effort to fund, and we’re phasing it in over time as feasible. The additional cameras bolster an already strong network, affording UI security and law enforcement personnel the opportunity to better monitor activity and take action when needed.
 
From individual behavior, to group consciousness, to physical tools and resources, there are many facets to campus safety. Our evolving university programs and practices are a strong foundation for a safe campus. We can all be glad that we have dedicated students, faculty and staff who know that we are a stronger community when we look out for each other as a Vandal family. Driving away from campus after dropping off a student is tough enough — parents and families leave UI knowing that their student is in a place that supports them on their educational journey.

Here's the Latest News from the University of Idaho

	

Local Vandals Leaving Their Mark on Idaho Athletics


Melissa ’04 and Dustin Weitz of Moscow have been loyal supporters of the Vandal Scholarship Fund <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=dcd57b5947&e=55d7947efc>  for years. Melissa just completed her tenure as vice president of the Latah County Vandal Booster Club where she served on the event committee for the local VSF golf tournament. With her help, they raised a record $59,573. The most popular auction item that night was a Vandal golf cart, donated by the Weitz family, that sold for $6,000. “I think it is important for all alumni to give back,” said Melissa. “We choose to support the VSF because it benefits the university as a whole.” This fall, she will serve as president of the Latah County Vandal Booster Club. “I am thrilled to lead the local board. We have an amazing group of volunteers who work hard to give back to the university.” For more information on the Vandal Scholarship Fund, please contact Brent Vicino at 208-885-0216 or bvicino@uidaho.edu <mailto:bvicino@uidaho.edu> .


UI and WSU Receive Wildfires Grant


More than 6,000 fires have burned more than 1 million acres in the Northwest so far in 2015, with experts predicting continuing severe wildfires in coming years. To help Northwest communities prepare for the future, University of Idaho and Washington State University researchers are studying ways to increase communities’ ability to withstand and recover from wildfires with the support of a new $2.8 million grant <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=3904129bc5&e=55d7947efc>  from the National Science Foundation. An interdisciplinary research team will focus on improving models that predict where fires are likely to occur, how severe they will be and whether they are likely to produce post-fire floods and landslides. The team will then create a virtual early warning system to help identify particularly vulnerable communities and ecosystems in the region. The researchers will work closely with an advisory team of academic, government and industry stakeholders to help translate the research results into action plans for communities at risk.


UI Highly Ranked in Washington Monthly


The University of Idaho ranks No. 61 in the nation <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=9a8c8753a3&e=55d7947efc>  among national universities, according to Washington Monthly’s 2015 rankings released Monday. Only the University of Washington ranked higher among national universities in the Northwest. The rankings are based on “contribution to the public good,” which include social mobility, research and service. UI scored especially high in the “service” subcategories, including Peace Corps participation, ROTC programming, and financial aid support. On Washington Monthly’s separate “Best Bang for Your Buck” ranking, UI placed No. 43 among more than 200 schools in the Western region. The “Best Bang for Your Buck” <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=5f246fa7b4&e=55d7947efc>  rating reflects “the best value for your money” based on factors including net price, graduation rates and financial success after graduation.

Dear Friends, 	
This week, we announced the chair of the Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories Endowed Chair in Power Engineering <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=bfac6192c7&e=55d7947efc> . Brian K. Johnson, a professor in the College of Engineering’s electrical and computer engineering department, brings national recognition in the field, a track record of securing and completing exciting research, and a deep commitment to the success of students. This is a great choice for SEL’s first-ever endowed chair <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=5598290c93&e=55d7947efc>  at a university, and we’re very grateful to have their vote of confidence in our excellence.

SEL has been a valued partner of UI for many years. A global leader in power technology, SEL employs more than 250 UI alumni out of 4,000 employees worldwide. They also offer internship opportunities, assist with student projects and research, sponsor College of Engineering programs, and participate in our annual Engineering Design Expo.

A $2 million gift from SEL makes this endowed chair possible. That generosity translates to income of about $90,000 per year, in perpetuity. Those funds provide partial salary support for the designated chair, as well as flexible funds to enhance graduate and undergraduate research, equipment, or other needs to move Professor Johnson’s work forward. SEL is a world-class company, and as we strive to be a world-class university, we’re glad to have a partner on the Palouse helping us achieve lofty goals.

UI engages with industry at many levels, relationships from which industries and our university both benefit. When we partner with industry, whether it’s through a new faculty or chair position, or through sponsored research, faculty and students find opportunities to work in real-world settings, identifying major problems. Similarly, internships lead to the acquisition of skills and often to great jobs. We sustain industry with a talent pipeline of graduates well-prepared to contribute to leading-edge organizations. Our research expertise allows us to address issues that affect industry and keep them strong for our state and our region.

During my presidency, we’ve remapped the way we engage with industry, especially in respect to our intellectual property (IP) agreements. It’s now easier for companies to benefit from intellectual property created during research projects they support. UI retains the right to publish research — a critical part of our university mission. Those changes first bore fruit with a research agreement with SEL, and UI has gone on to forge agreements with Idaho Power Company, with Avista Corporation and, now, just this August, with Micron Technology Inc.

These enhancements are new and robust, positioning us well for the future. They follow a historic pattern of UI engagement with industry. For more than 100 years we’ve worked with industries important to Idaho, including in fields like agriculture and natural resources, where research has contributed to new potato and wheat varieties, better agricultural and forestry practices, and improved training and know-how for industry and communities.

This week Dr. Schweitzer said something that sticks with me. As a freshman at Purdue, his Engineering 101 professor asked, “Why do you want to be an engineer?” He said becoming an engineer meant he could “take science, math and technology, and put them to work to improve the world.” He certainly has done that at SEL. It’s also what we do at UI across fields of research and scholarly activity — put concepts into action. We Vandals work on ideas that matter — a framework that you’ll be hearing more about in the future as we lay out a vision for UI in our strategic planning.

After graduation, Rigby hopes to pursue a career in public relations in the music industry or a job as a corresponding reporter.


UI Helps Improve Clothing for Wildland Firefighters


Clothing that can protect firefighters so they can protect the public is very much on the mind of University of Idaho clothing, textiles and design professor Sonya Meyer these days. Meyer, UI School of Family and Consumer Sciences director at Moscow, is part of a national project to review wildland firefighters’ clothing <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=31d01d103d&e=55d7947efc>  to find ways to improve its effectiveness, comfort and safety. The team’s project includes creation of clothing prototypes. The team will also study ways to give wildland firefighters better information about how to use and care for their protective clothing. The five-year project was sponsored by the U.S. Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture in 2012.

2015-09-11,Great Examples of Vandal Energy,"September 11, 2015

Dear Friends, 	
Maybe you’ve experienced something like this in your own lives, whether you work at a company, go to school or are involved in community organizations. Invariably, there are people making things happen behind the scenes. The lights stay on, the facilities stay clean, the services continue on as expected — the work gets done.

That holds true at the University of Idaho. The work gets done - a routine excellence that can sometimes go unnoticed. One thing I and others have definitely noticed over the past year, however, is the work of our Steam Plant crew. They keep the lights on, of course, but they also have fun while doing it. About a year ago I first saw a pair of skeletons <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=f3991f9747&e=55d7947efc>  in the street-level window on 6th Street. I’m sure I had the reaction many others have had — surprise, a chuckle, and another look at the building and reflection about its role at UI.

Since then, the Steam Plant crew has regularly arranged and rearranged the skeletons to play off the mood or goings-on at UI or in the broader world. For instance, in late spring the skeletons had books in hand, studying for finals. They broke out a beach ball to welcome summer, then grabbed American flags and joined us in celebrating the Fourth of July. They even hopped on a bicycle to get in some exercise at one point.

Part of the skeletons’ job is to draw some attention to the Steam Plant, and I think they have succeeded in that. The plant is a facility of which we can be very proud <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=27d3b76d41&e=55d7947efc> . Many university energy plants run on fossil fuels — but not ours. Our plant runs on biomass, cedar wood chip, for 90 percent of its fuel. That waste is a renewable resource <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=7da2cfadc3&e=55d7947efc>  that doesn’t add carbon to the environment, unlike fossil fuels. And the sourcing of the fuel from nearby sawmills means UI supports local industries that keep Idahoans at work and our economy strong.

The skeletons also succeed in lifting our spirits. Whether you’re a student walking past and thinking about your next class, or an employee reflecting on some of the stress of the job, the skeletons provide a chance to smile, to enjoy a break from your routine, and be connected with others to the spirit of the university. That creative, quirky Vandal spirit shows up in a lot of ways, from our Vandal Marching Band to our Homecoming festivities every year. I appreciate how this particular staff crew connects and contributes to that feeling.

It’s a lesson in fun and imagination that we can all take to heart because let’s face it, higher education can be stressful. Now, not everyone needs to start putting skeletons in their windows. But congratulations to the Steam Plant crew for their ingenuity and generosity of spirit. They represent the many Vandals who make our university a great place <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=0d56e8e783&e=55d7947efc>  to work, live and learn. My hats off to them, and to the Vandal faculty and staff who contribute immeasurably to our university all year round.

Mark and Laurie Engberg Transforming Art and Architecture


In August, Mark and Laurie Engberg made a transformational gift to the College of Art and Architecture. Combined with two new current-use gifts, their commitment of a planned estate gift totals more than $1 million, making it the largest gift ever received by the college. The Engberg’s generous support will provide necessary resources for the college to expand its high-performance building studio and will support scholarships for students pursuing majors in the college. “The University of Idaho and the College of Art and Architecture provided me with a great education and opportunity,” said Mark Engberg of his lasting support. “Now, it is time for us to give back and make a difference for the next generation.” For more information on giving to the College of Art and Architecture <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=fd381c4d88&e=55d7947efc> , please contact either Jim Zuba at (208) 885-4142 or jzuba@uidaho.edu <mailto:jzuba@uidaho.edu>  or Dean Mark Hoversten at (208) 885-5423 or hoverstm@uidaho.edu <mailto:hoverstm@uidaho.edu> .


UI to Host First-Ever National Tribal Climate Boot Camp


Climate change has a direct impact on Native American communities through disruption to local economies and traditional cultures. To help address these impacts, members of tribes from across the United States will convene at the University of Idaho’s McCall Field Campus in June 2016 for the first-ever National Tribal Climate Boot Camp <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=dbf2e82ebf&e=55d7947efc> . The U.S. Department of the Interior’s Northwest Climate Science Center, in which UI is a partner, will model the event after its annual Climate Boot Camp that prepares graduate students and early-career professionals to understand and adapt to climate change. The National Tribal Climate Boot Camp will bring together early-career professionals from among the 83 member tribes of the Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians and United South and Eastern Tribes for a weeklong intensive educational experience to learn about climate-related impacts, with a specific focus on issues connected to tribal needs and concerns.


UI Partners to Build New Exhibit about Boise Watershed


The University of Idaho Boise is proud to partner with CH2MHill, the city of Boise and Boise WaterShed Exhibits to support the construction of the Boise WaterShed River Campus <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=121516f2ac&e=55d7947efc>  for the expanded Boise WaterShed Environmental Education Center. The Boise WaterShed River Campus construction, now underway, will be completed in the summer of 2016. These new exhibits will provide STEM career exposure and water conservation and protection content appropriate for school field trips, family outings and teacher professional development. Ralph Budwig, director of UI’s Center for Ecohydraulics Research StreamLab, is teaming up with the Boise WaterShed River Campus design team to simulate flows proposed for the representative river that will flow through the new campus using a flume located on the first floor of the UI Boise Water Center, home to a uniquely equipped ecohydraulics lab. The flume will be used to create a full-scale model of the river that will flow through the new outdoor campus.

Dear Friends, 	
Next week we celebrate the opening of the new Idaho Law and Justice Learning Center <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=e7cd2a3473&e=55d7947efc>  in Boise, a collaboration between our University of Idaho College of Law and the Idaho Supreme Court. In the former Ada County Courthouse, a stone’s throw from the Capitol, the center is a unique venue for legal education and civic engagement, and hosts the Idaho State Law Library. I’m looking forward to the impact this center will have for students, for faculty members and for legal education in our state. The ILJLC is the culmination of Don Burnett’s vision; I thank our former president and dean of the law school on behalf of our state and our university.

The new center offers an opportunity to further extend UI’s superb legal education to our state’s largest urban center. UI expanded to include a second year of programs in Boise, and we plan to add a first-year component <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=abc62fe2f7&e=55d7947efc>  to that program in 2017, pending approval from the State Board of Education and the American Bar Association. This dual-location approach presents a flexible way for students to take advantage of a UI legal education that is clearly in demand. Many law schools nationwide are experiencing enrollment declines, but UI Law has successfully navigated <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=4ca69a8a79&e=55d7947efc>  a challenging environment while maintaining quality and increasing resident students and diversity.

The careers and good works of Vandal graduates prove UI Law’s excellence every day. For many years our law school graduates have been leaders in bench and bar in the courtrooms of Idaho. Currently four of the five justices on the Idaho Supreme Court, and three out of the four justices on the Idaho Court of Appeals call UI their alma mater. A UI grad, Linda Copple Trout, was the first female justice named to the Idaho Supreme Court — one of many groundbreaking Vandal graduates who have emerged from our law school.

Not all graduates serve in the legal profession, of course. Vandals from the College of Law include leaders such as Frank Shrontz, the former CEO of Boeing; Mas Kawana, a 2006 J.D. recipient from UI, the executive director and head of tax operations for JPMorgan Chase in New York; and Nancy Morris, the former secretary of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. From business, to marketing, to government and beyond, it’s clear that a legal education from UI is great preparation for success in many careers.

While our law school continues to have a valued home in Moscow, we are excited to have future generations of leaders in many professions take classes in the heart of Boise. Dean Mark Adams recently said it well: “The hard work of many people is paying off in the opening of this center. It’s a great symbol for the exciting things that are happening at the College of Law. The future is filled with possibilities we’re ready to embrace.”

I share that optimism, and look forward to the Idaho Law and Justice Learning Center becoming a landmark of excellence of which all Idahoans can be proud.

Laura Moore Cunningham Foundation Supports UI

A gift of $535,000 from the Laura Moore Cunningham Foundation to the University of Idaho will help fund student scholarships as well as furnishings for the newly renovated College of Education <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=b9bcc1d97f&e=55d7947efc> . Half of the gift ($270,000) will go toward general scholarship funds, with an additional $15,000 to the Andrew Joseph “A.J.” Gray University of Idaho/WWAMI Scholarship Endowment. “It’s rewarding to provide more than 450 Idaho students a year some help with shouldering the rising economic burden of college fees and tuition,” said Harry Bettis, president of the Boise-based foundation, which has supported UI for more than 40 years. An additional $250,000 was gifted to the College of Education to assist in the furnishings and technology for the innovative design and renovation of the Moscow campus building.

The award — which means “Friend of the Year” — is presented to a recipient who has gone beyond his or her work responsibilities to reach out to Hispanic communities in Idaho and who has a vested interest in the human rights issues that affect the Hispanic population. “Ms. Salant has demonstrated a sincere and caring role in closing the disparities that exist between the Hispanic and the non-Hispanic populations,” said Margie Gonzalez, ICHA executive director. “We are honored to be presenting this award; Ms. Salant is very deserving.” As director of UI’s McClure Center, part of the College of Letters, Arts and Social Sciences, Salant conducts and promotes research on public policy issues that impact Idaho, the region and the nation. For the last 25 years, she has built connections between universities and their statewide constituents, with a focus on rural and leadership development. 

College Scorecard Data Confirms UI Excellence

This week, the Obama administration and U.S. Department of Education unveiled College Scorecard <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=c84d13caf8&e=55d7947efc> , a new data site that provides comprehensive data on education costs and student outcomes of universities across the nation. The new data showcases the University of Idaho’s graduation rate, average salaries after graduation, and affordability compared to other institutions <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=ec2ef3e3f7&e=55d7947efc> . “This new site is a wonderful tool for high school students and their parents to explore their educational opportunities,” said President Chuck Staben. “The side-by-side comparison makes it clear that a Vandal education is an affordable investment in a great future.” UI is above the national average for graduation rates (55 percent), first-year retention (79 percent) and graduate salaries. The data also reveals that over half of UI’s students receive federal assistance to help pay for college.

Dear Friends, 	
This week at the University of Idaho, our College of Natural Resources <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=4d1a847c77&e=55d7947efc> , Office of Tribal Relations <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=762335b427&e=55d7947efc>  and tribal partners from across the region came together in an important summit at UI. The 2015 Tribal Natural Resource Education Summit brought together UI faculty members and administrators and tribal leaders and professionals. The summit is one example of how UI can collaborate with Native American communities to meet needs and embrace opportunities.

The summit grew out of discussions our university has had within the President’s Native American Advisory Council. Last spring as a council we worked to identify opportunities to leverage UI resources and expertise with the experience and insight of tribal leadership and professionals. Natural resources are an important part of tribal economies, culture and traditional knowledge, so as a group we realized that the College of Natural Resources had a role to play in partnership. The summit focuses on developing educational capacity within the college to enhance tribal workforce development.

The day-and-a-half summit features speakers, presenters and panelists from UI and from the tribal nations that have a memorandum of understanding <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=fe193f20cb&e=55d7947efc>  (MOU) with the university. That MOU is a guiding document that bespeaks a commitment to strengthening the relationship between the university and signatory tribes. (In Spring 2015 the Yakama Nation joined as the 10th MOU member.) I’m pleased that that this summit represents concrete action that aligns with that goal, and I look forward to more discussion with the MOU tribes in November at our next advisory council meeting.

Next summer the university’s engagement with tribes will reach across an even broader spectrum of Native American communities. The University of Idaho will host the first-ever National Tribal Climate Boot Camp <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=b30798465f&e=55d7947efc> , with members of tribes from across the United States convening at our McCall Field Campus. Tribal leaders will work with faculty from UI and other research universities on programs and training for the week-long educational experience. It’s another opportunity to examine needs and opportunities, learn from traditional knowledge and perspectives, and find ways to partner in addressing the challenges posed by climate-related impacts.

Many people at UI work very hard to create an environment for collaboration with our Native American partners. It’s an area where we’ve exercised leadership and have taken steps to better sustain the resources found at our state’s leading, national research university. It’s also undoubtedly an area where we can do more. I’m grateful to have MOU tribes engaged with us on improvement, and I know that all of us will benefit from that hard work in the future.

Dotys Honor Legacies with CLASS Support

College of Letters, Arts and Social Sciences (CLASS) alumni Ben ’53 and Pat Doty ’54 cherished their experience at the University of Idaho. It's not only where they met, but it is also where they received the education that gave them a jumpstart in life. Their life together has taken them to amazing places and amazing heights. Ben served as a major general in the army while Pat took command in successfully raising their children. Their Vandal experience meant so much to them that Ben recently created a new endowment in journalism and political science that will provide two scholarships and a faculty award. ""We are honored that Ben has chosen to honor the Doty family legacy with these two scholarships and a faculty award in CLASS,” said CLASS Dean Andrew Kersten. “His gift will have a significant and lasting impact for years to come.” For more information on supporting the programs in CLASS, contact Peter Mundt at (208) 885-5013 or peterm@uidaho.edu <mailto:peterm@uidaho.edu> . 

Dean Baird Honored as Librarian of the Year

Lynn Baird worked her first library job as an undergraduate student at University of Pacific, putting labels on the spines of books. It was there and by attending a conference with the university's librarians that she became inspired to begin a career in library sciences - a path that has led her to being selected as this year's Librarian of the Year <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=3b809ef036&e=55d7947efc>  by the Idaho Library Association. Baird, along with some of her librarians, will attend the awards ceremony and banquet Thursday at Boise State University. Baird said all of the work she's done throughout the years, including with international organizations, has been to help advance libraries in a way that everyone has access and an opportunity to gain knowledge. 

Sage Grouse Listing Validates Collaborative Approaches

The decision on Tuesday, Sept. 22, by the Department of Interior to not list sage grouse under the Endangered Species Act validates the hard work and collaboration <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=ba17e5505c&e=55d7947efc>  of many agencies, landowners and the University of Idaho. “Conserving sage grouse is a complex challenge that requires the collective efforts of land managers, scientists and all those who enjoy the vast sagebrush ecosystems. This announcement is a tribute to the hard work and dedication of many people,” said Karen Launchbaugh, professor in the College of Natural Resources and director of the UI Rangeland Center. The Rangeland Center has been a leader in helping ranchers better understand the relationships between grazing and sage grouse habitat. “I am encouraged that research, education and management can join together in efforts to sustain the ecological and economic values that we hold dear in the west,” Launchbaugh said.

Dear Friends, 	
This week I offered the 2015 State of the University address <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=746e80523a&e=55d7947efc>  to students, faculty and staff, community members and others who joined us over the web from near and far. I wanted to give everyone an update on some of our successes from the past year and current work upon which we’re engaged. Importantly, I also wanted to express my belief in our shared purpose as Idaho’s leading institution of higher education, and describe a vision for the University of Idaho’s next 10 years.

Across the state of Idaho, we are changing lives through access to an affordable, high-quality education at a research university. We can and will make that “transformative education” possible for more students. Too many qualified students, especially students from Idaho, don’t go on to postsecondary education. That represents lost opportunities for individual students, as well as for our state. With focus and innovation, over the next 10 years, we can reshape Idaho’s higher education landscape and strengthen our university. We have exciting initiatives that will bring the value of higher education to our state’s high school students, educating them about their options and communicating next steps <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=dc7395ad9f&e=55d7947efc>  toward their pursuit of the American Dream.

Another area where our university excels, and where we can move forward with renewed focus, is in research, scholarly activity and creative work. At UI, that discovery and innovation is the pursuit of “ideas that matter <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=3e73f997cd&e=55d7947efc> .” The caliber, scope and amount of research we do at UI sets us apart — double the combined total of other state institutions. We can be proud of the research that shapes our world for the better in everything from complex systems modeling, to wildfire research, to cybersecurity. Going forward, interdisciplinary research <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=e101448e65&e=55d7947efc>  will be the key to breaking new ground and accelerating the impact that UI has for our state and our world.

Lastly, I explored the urgency of “building our team.” We need to continue to make sure the university is a great place not just to work but to build a career, and that it is a purpose-driven organization, a vibrant intellectual community that attracts, retains, and develops great faculty and staff. It’s no secret that employee compensation that has lagged behind some of our peer institutions and regional competitors. To continue to attract and retain the workforce that makes our university be the best it can be, we need to meet goals for growth that allow us to invest in our people. You can’t buy loyalty, but you can lose loyalty. For our students and our state, we cannot let that happen.

Recently in my office, we found an old document — a plan by President Donald Theophilus, penned in 1959, and outlining a vision for the next 10 years, through 1970. Those themes and goals from more than 50 years ago still resonate today. That tells me that at UI, we know who we are. We know who we serve. And we know that we need to continue to work together to build a stronger UI … driven by purpose, motivated by excellence, and passionate about the future and all it will bring.

2015-10-16,FRIDAY LETTER: Be a Vandal VIP,"October 16, 2015 	
 <https://gallery.mailchimp.com/e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef/images/78d0092c-6b67-41ab-8113-fb516677185b.jpg> 	
	
Dear Friends, 	
As president of the University of Idaho, I’m often asked about our current work and future initiatives — as one would expect. Oftentimes, such questions are posed in an interesting way: What are you doing about enrollment? How will you ensure access and affordability for more students? Now, that phrasing often just reflects a shorthand approach to a complicated topic, but the real question is how we will all work together to move the university and Idaho forward.

Of course, our staff and faculty are working very hard on many initiatives, including increasing enrollment. But the university has a not-so-secret weapon that I think we can engage more fully: the Vandal alumni base. This is a network — a family, we proudly say — of more than 100,000 people who have experienced firsthand the transformative impact of a Vandal education. What better ambassadors could there be for the University of Idaho?

With that in mind, I’m pleased to announce our new Vandals in Partnership (VIP) program <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=5f9f25bc85&e=55d7947efc> . The Vandals in Partnership program taps into the enthusiasm and experience of alumni volunteers to make a difference for undergraduate student enrollment. It starts with our successful “Grow the Gold” <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=66ad4a0f77&e=55d7947efc>  program, which asks alumni to nominate students for admission to UI, kicking off a relationship between a prospective student and UI. The new VIP program goes beyond “Grow the Gold,” giving alumni volunteers the chance to get involved in undergraduate student recruitment at whatever level of commitment makes sense for them.

Want to share your personal story with prospective students at recruitment events? Want to get involved with UI admissions and alumni representatives to discuss approaches to recruitment? Want to really get involved by participating in panels at events, meeting one-on-one with students, or attending college fairs and other events as a UI representative? We want to use your time and talents. Your first step is simply visiting the Vandals in Partnership <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=9887651708&e=55d7947efc>  website for more background, and a quick sign-up. VIPs will receive a packet of information about being a volunteer recruiter, and we’ll work with you to provide all the material you need to represent your university.

Growing enrollment <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=3bd23eedd5&e=55d7947efc>  has been a goal of mine since I started as president at the University of Idaho. It is our mission as a university to serve the students of Idaho and beyond. Education unlocks doors for students, strengthens communities, and unleashes innovation and growth for industry in our state and our world. We’re going to keep spreading that message, and you’ll hear more from me on this topic in the weeks ahead. Our alumni already know very well with the value of an education from Idaho’s leading, national research university, and that’s why we’re enlisting that insight and passion.

What are we doing to shape the future of the University of Idaho, and change the college-going culture in Idaho? That’s a question that, through the VIP program, can be answered by the best ambassadors a university can have — the alumni and friends who are committed to sharing its good work.

American Chemical Society Supports Future Teachers

The American Chemical Society recently made a $12,000 gift to the Department of Chemistry. The gift will fund two scholarships for chemistry majors who are planning to become high school chemistry teachers as part of the ACS-Hach Land Grant Undergraduate Scholarship Program. The program was initiated by the Hach Scientific Foundation, which was established in 1982 by Hach Company founders Clifford and Kitty Hach, and was transferred to ACS in 2009. In total, the Hach Foundation and ACS have provided more than $100,000 in scholarship funding for UI students. “Receiving the ACS-Hach Scholarship has made my dream of teaching chemistry to high school students a reality,” said Megan Paul, a current recipient. “I am able to attend school without worrying about how I am going to finance my education. I am so thankful for this scholarship.” For more information about giving to the College of Science <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=2b19b2730a&e=55d7947efc> , please contact Eric Bennett at (208) 885-9106 or ebennett@uidaho.edu <mailto:ebennett@uidaho.edu> . 

Professor Chosen as One of Most Innovative Educators

UI Chemical and Materials engineering faculty member Soumya Srivastava has been selected by the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) as one of the nation's 70 most innovative, young engineering educators <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=32037e635e&e=55d7947efc> . Srivastava’s research focuses on electrokinetic simulations and design of microfluidic systems for medical diagnostic applications along with educational research including enhancing student engagement and learning. She currently teaches courses in bioengineering, process analysis and controls, and engineering thermodynamics and heat transfer. “My approach to teaching involves active student engagement and enhancing learning through short activities to develop discussions on the practical applications of course content,” Srivastava said. “I ask students for regular feedback by incorporating it into biweekly class assignments.” Srivastava operates the Microfluidics and Electrokinetics bioSeparation and Analysis (MESA) Laboratory, which studies microfluidic transport phenomena and the design of fluidic devices with health care applications. Srivastava’s MESA lab supports the research and education of two graduate students and three undergraduate research assistants. One of the lab’s goals is to design commercially viable microdevices for clinical diagnostics. 

Grant Provides Rehabilitation Counseling Scholarships

University of Idaho faculty members in the Rehabilitation Counseling and Human Services Program (RCHS), in the College of Education’s Department of Leadership and Counseling, have been awarded a five-year, $1 million Rehabilitation Training grant <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=25e9704c3d&e=55d7947efc>  from the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services-Rehabilitation Services Administration to provide academic training in vocational rehabilitation counseling and attract highly capable applicants. Employment of rehabilitation counselors is expected to grow by 28 percent from 2010-20, faster than the average for all occupations, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. The grant will help attract more candidates to become rehabilitation counselors in Idaho and will support students through scholarships to attend the two-year Rehabilitation Counseling and Human Services master’s program at UI’s Boise or Coeur d’Alene locations. The university plans to award the first seven scholarships to current enrolled students at the UI RCHS program and continue awarding scholarships to 42 students during the next five years.

Dear Friends, 	
This is a special time of year. On campus and across the state, we bundle up in Vandal gear, as the October days get chillier. In our arboretum, fall colors are on full display. Midterms have come and gone, to the relief and satisfaction of students and professors alike. Our Vandal football team, fresh off a hard-earned road victory, returns to the Kibbie Dome — just named one of the Top 10 football stadiums in the nation <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=648869deb4&e=55d7947efc>  by USA Today, by the way. It is Homecoming at the University of Idaho <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=449739d708&e=55d7947efc> .

This year’s Homecoming theme is “A Hero’s Homecoming.” It’s a special week where we come together to honor the heroes in our lives and focus on the hero in all of us. In keeping with this year’s theme and with long traditions, the week has been filled with festivities and service to others. Vandals participated in school spirit competitions and decorated downtown, UI offices and living spaces. Vandals have also been busy this week meeting needs in our local community. On Thursday, students collected food for local foodbanks, and supplies for a local violence and abuse prevention and support organization. They also organized and participated in UI’s annual blood drive, a time-honored tradition. Rafe Gibbs notes in “Beacon for Mountain and Plain,” a history of the University of Idaho, that campus blood drives started on behalf of wounded servicemen in the Korean War, and Vandal students “became nationally famous as blood-donating champions.”

I am glad that spirit of service <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=30b77ee26d&e=55d7947efc> , these small acts of heroism, continues with today’s students. Tonight we’ll rally around the bonfire after the serpentine to crown this year’s Homecoming Royalty. These events are fun, but they’re also a lot of work to organize, so we should give thanks to the many student leaders who take their time to help create lasting memories we can all share.

Tomorrow, the Homecoming parade will pour through downtown Moscow, one of the best college towns in America. We are proud to have the four ROTC units on campus <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=491155daa7&e=55d7947efc>  — the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines — as our Grand Marshalls this year. Vandal ROTC members serve their university and their nation with commitment, courage and sacrifice. As we enjoy meeting friends at the tailgate or in the Fan Zone, and as we watch our Vandals compete on the gridiron, we can be grateful for our Grand Marshalls’ example of heroic service.

Many Vandals return to the Moscow campus during Homecoming. Our alumni set the example for current and future generations. Some have sons and daughters forging their own Vandal legacies. I look forward to renewing acquaintances and meeting new friends this week, saluting our heroes in the Armed Forces, and being reminded that there can be a hero in all of us.

2015-10-30,FRIDAY LETTER: Changing Our College-going Culture,"October 30, 2015 	
 <https://gallery.mailchimp.com/e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef/images/78d0092c-6b67-41ab-8113-fb516677185b.jpg> 	
Dear Friends, 	
Two years ago tomorrow, I was on my way to Boise. I’d just interviewed for the job of president of the University of Idaho, and was traveling to meet with the State Board of Education. Stopping in Grangeville for lunch at a diner, I struck up a conversation with our server, a high school senior. Asking him about his college plans, I learned that he didn’t have any. He’d not thought much about college. Neither had many of his friends.

Unfortunately, that’s an all-too-common story. As many as 5,000 qualified high school students in Idaho don’t “go on” to higher education every year. For these students, that’s a tragedy, and for our state, that is a missed opportunity. While a college degree is not for everyone, for many more students, it can be the path toward a better life with more financial stability, increased personal satisfaction, and stronger civic engagement. In short, a college degree is a road to attaining the American Dream.

Working with the State Board of Education and other stakeholders, UI is posed to make that road to the American Dream that much easier. The first step in getting to college, of course, is applying. That task is more complex than it may seem, something I discovered when testing out our application procedures. Now, there are many hurdles on the way to college, but students shouldn’t be tripping over the first one. We needed to make some changes.

As a state with the nation’s only united K-20 system, we’re in a position to make quick, straightforward changes to our processes. The State Board of Education has just mailed out a letter to qualified high school students, letting them know which Idaho institutions of public higher education they have been already been conditionally admitted to based on their track record of achievement in high school. We’re following up on that letter with proactive communications of our own, saying to many of those 5,000 students and their parents: You can succeed at the next level, you belong in college, and we want you to take that next step <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=76f6f7163f&e=55d7947efc> .

We’re going even further, meeting the students where they live by hosting informational Enroll Idaho events at 43 locations across the state <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=c00e48bc3b&e=55d7947efc>  on Tuesday, Nov. 10. (To stay in the know with timely updates, join our Enroll Idaho event page <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=c5aab2bec2&e=55d7947efc>  on Facebook.) We’re going to showcase the value of higher education <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=13ca1e8589&e=55d7947efc>  in general, and let students know how to take the next steps toward their college dream <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=b3dc8d596c&e=55d7947efc> . I’ll personally head back to Grangeville to meet with students there before going up to Coeur d’Alene for the Enroll Kootenai County event that night.

Following up on those steps, I’ve asked our James A. and Louise McClure Center for Public Policy Research to study the transition from high school to college. Their Idaho at a Glance report on the subject will come out in January, and will help us design policies and practices that promote postsecondary enrollment and attainment. We’ll also reach out again to students across Idaho with FAFSA-completion workshops and other recruitment events.

There is no single solution to increasing the go-on rates in Idaho. UI can and will be the leader in that effort, though. We will hold the door to the American Dream open for more Idaho students. For students in Coeur d’Alene, in Boise, in Grangeville and in communities large and small across Idaho, we must change the college-going culture to one that asks not “Should I go to college?” but “Where should I go to college?” It will take commitment by all stakeholders, on behalf of all of Idaho, but we can succeed.

UI Professor Named to Top Women in STEM List

Higher education magazine INSIGHT Into Diversity has named Holly Wichman, a University of Idaho Distinguished Professor of biological sciences, among its 2015 100 Inspiring Women in STEM <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=1eb5e17e3d&e=55d7947efc>  (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). Wichman, who came to UI in 1988 and earned the rank of Distinguished Professor in 2012, was recognized for her outstanding research, commitment to collaboration, and role as a mentor to faculty and students in her department and across campus. Wichman’s areas of research expertise include viral evolution and unusual DNA sequences known as transposable elements. She’s a founding member of the Institute for Bioinformatics and Evolutionary Studies, known as IBEST, and led the formation of UI’s new Center for Modeling Complex Interactions, which earned a $10.6 million grant from the National Institutes of Health in May 2015. 

UI Partner in $1.2 Million Food Safety Grant

The University of Idaho will lead efforts across Idaho, Washington, Oregon and Alaska through a newly funded $1.2 million food safety center <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=d211a13f36&e=55d7947efc>  to help small and midsized farms and food processors improve food safety. The U.S. Department of Agriculture launched a national initiative to help farmers and food and animal feed producers comply with requirements established under the 2011 Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA). The virtual center, based at Oregon State University, is one of four new regional hubs across the country. UI, Oregon State and other universities across the 13-state western region will train others to teach food safety and regulatory compliance. They also will conduct workshops for small and midsized farms, beginning farmers, small-scale food processors, wholesale produce vendors and others. “This center will assist small farms and food processors with technical assistance in complying with the FSMA rules by providing approximately two dozen lead trainers and about 200 other people as certified trainers across the region,” said Barbara Petty, UI Extension interim director.

2015-11-06,FRIDAY LETTER: How Small Change Adds Up,"November 6, 2015 	
 <https://gallery.mailchimp.com/e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef/images/78d0092c-6b67-41ab-8113-fb516677185b.jpg> 	
Dear Friends, 	
How many times have you had this happen? You find a couple pennies, or nickels or quarters on the ground. They wind up at the bottom of your washing machine, or stuck in the seat of your car, or at the back of a drawer. Wherever they are, maybe they come in useful now and again, but they’re probably not serving a greater good. That’s okay. It’s just spare change, after all, right?

Not at UI, though. If you haven’t heard of the “Found Money Fund,” <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=6d7eeb8016&e=55d7947efc>  it’s one of the quirky, creative traditions that are such a part of our university. The idea started <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=b3a819697e&e=55d7947efc>  with Terry Armstrong, a longtime Vandal administrator and professor, and staff member Catherine Yenni Wilson. Both were Vandals through and through, dedicated to students and to the university. Walking by a fraternity house on campus one day in 1981, Terry found three pennies on the ground and put them in a jar. Others dropped loose change in the jar, as well. Soon, a campus tradition was born.

Needing a place to deposit all those nickels and dimes and stray bills, the Found Money Fund endowment was created. It has been added to through the years by contributions from alumni, faculty, staff and students the world over, who occasionally mail in loose change and bills — a small but appreciated gesture that complements a great spirit of donor generosity. Terry passed away last year, but the Found Money Fund is one way in which his legacy lives on. I actually first heard about the fund from a colleague with whom I worked at the University of South Dakota, and who wanted to start such a fund at that institution — proof that a good idea travels far.

Per Terry Armstrong’s wishes, the fund will mature in 2089. When it does, it will be used to enhance the university — its programs, its students, its faculty and staff — in ways that we might not imagine from our vantage point today. Now, 2089 offers a long horizon for adding to the fund and for watching interest accrue. With about $344,000 in the fund already, with steady contributions and a reasonable interest rate, we estimate that the fund will generate many millions of dollars after 73 years. That’s not such small change anymore, now is it?

Recently, we’ve relaunched the Found Money Fund. We actually have a fleet of little piggy banks that are hoping to find homes across campus. I encourage faculty, staff and students who are interested in supporting this project to learn more <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=6bcd828086&e=55d7947efc> , and maybe adopt a piggy bank of their own.

The Found Money Fund will mature long after many of us are gone. That’s part of the point, though. Little by little, with each nickel and each dime, we have a chance to express a belief in a better world for our students, for our children and for all those who come after us. So don’t feel silly about bending over to pick up those pennies. That spare change can and will add up to something special for the world to come.

Go Vandals!

P.S.: Speaking of traditions, I had started my own with a racquetball contest. Beat me in racquetball, and I’ll buy you lunch, I’ve been saying to undergraduates. I hadn’t had to spring for lunch since coming to UI – until this week. Cristobal Ramos Salazar, a key part of our men’s tennis team last year and an assistant with the team this year, beat me two games to none. The first game was close, the second, less so. My hat’s off to Cristobal for a great match. As a member of our Athletics staff mentioned, “Dr. Staben might consider training” if he wants to win. That’s probably a good lesson for all of us. Until then, I look forward to buying lunch for Cristobal and any other undergraduates who feel up to the challenge.

Alumni Give Back to College of Education

Debbie Maxwell Long ’72 and ’81 and Kathy Canfield-Davis ’87 believe in being brave and bold. As alumni and College of Education employees, they also believe in giving back to the university that they love. Long, the North Idaho Regional Coordinator for the Idaho Building Capacity Project, and Canfield-Davis, chair for the Department of Leadership and Counseling, first met as special education directors in Northern Idaho more than 35 years ago. Besides giving their time and talent to UI, Long and Canfield-Davis jointly made a $25,000 gift to co-name a student space in the renovated Education building. “We have both held leadership positions in education for most of our careers,” Canfield-Davis said. “Deb and I are excited to give back and help create a comfortable, flexible environment that will encourage collaboration and active engagement among future Vandal leaders.” For information on supporting the College of Education <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=a01d173259&e=55d7947efc> , contact Marta McClintock at (208) 885-7476 or martam@uidaho.edu <mailto:martam@uidaho.edu> .

The Leaders in Law program recognizes outstanding legal professionals <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=09c55c46ed&e=55d7947efc>  in a number of areas, rewarding nominated individuals based on experience, dedication, hard work, compassion and excellence. The award “is dedicated to those individuals whose leadership, both in the legal profession and in the community, has a positive impact on Idaho.” Lee Dillion, associate dean for Boise programs, was named outstanding legal educator. University of Idaho College of Law graduates were also honored, for excellence as in-house counsel, as partners in firms across the state, and as an up-and-coming lawyer. The honorees will be recognized at the Idaho Business Review’s Leaders in Law event on November 17 in Boise, an event sponsored by the College of Law. 

UI Confucius Institute to Expand Programs to Boise

The University of Idaho Confucius Institute will open its doors in Boise <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=8cc66f3b04&e=55d7947efc>  in January 2016. Registration for Chinese language and Tai Chi classes runs November through December. Classes will take place at the University of Idaho Boise in the Idaho Water Center. Public school language programs and other art and community outreach events will also be part of the 2016 UI Confucius Institute cultural awareness series for Boise and the Treasure Valley. One of fewer than 100 institutes nationwide, the Confucius Institute opened at UI in Moscow in April 2013. The institute teaching staff is currently composed of five full-time Chinese teachers and two martial arts instructors; two new teachers will be based in Boise. “I think Asian languages, especially Chinese, are going to open up so many opportunities for people,” said Matt Wappett, institute co-director. “Having a basic understanding of Chinese cultures and the Chinese language gives you a very marketable skill. You’d be surprised where you can go if you speak Chinese.”

2015-11-13,FRIDAY LETTER: Vandal Leaders Give Back to UI,"November 13, 2015 	
 <https://gallery.mailchimp.com/e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef/images/78d0092c-6b67-41ab-8113-fb516677185b.jpg> 	
Dear Friends, 	
This morning, perhaps as you’re reading this, I have the pleasure of speaking to an All-Advisory Board gathering here in Moscow. This is part of an annual event we call Leadership Weekend at the University of Idaho, a chance to keep our closest alumni and friends in the loop about UI life and activities, benefit from their wisdom and experience, and, in the midst of a busy semester, get a dose of refreshment and renewed energy from this group.

We have many advisory boards at UI, representing each of our colleges and our University Foundation. Each of those boards is entirely comprised of volunteers. These are alumni and others who are passionate about the excellence of each college, and who in many cases had transformative educational experiences here at UI. They are giving back their time and talent to making sure our programs are robust and forward-thinking for future generations of Vandals. You might not always see their names and faces out in front, but these women and men are championing the UI experience every day, and striving to make our university all that it can be.

At the board gathering this morning, I’ll offer a look into the state of the university, and try to answer questions about how UI is performing and where it is headed. We’re in the process of developing our new strategic plan <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=3c46f4de95&e=55d7947efc> , an effort led by Provost and Executive Vice President John Wiencek, so it’s an opportune time to hear the insight of alumni and friends close to UI. We are committed to building a stronger university over the next 10 years, and a solid plan is central to achieving that goal.

On the subject of committed Vandals, Friday night marks our annual Recognition Gala in Moscow. This is another occasion to reconnect with supporters of the University of Idaho – the donors who help make transformative educations possible for students, and who make a commitment to ideas that matter in innovation and discovery. No university in this day and age can succeed without a dedicated network of private support. This year, even with the end of our Inspiring Futures: Invest in the University of Idaho campaign, we have realized a record fundraising total. That support, in the immediate future and in the long-term, will make a profound difference in the lives of students and for the exciting work that addresses issues and challenges in our lives.

Thanks to all alumni and friends to the university. For those students reading the Friday Letter, we hope you see in the leaders on campus this weekend a role model for success, for integrity and dedication, and for lifelong commitment to the Vandal family.

University Gala Recognizes 1889 Society

University of Idaho donors will gather tonight for the annual University Gala where several new members of the prestigious 1889 Society, recognizing alumni, friends and partners whose cumulative contributions total $1 million and more, will be inducted. The 2015 inductees include Ed and Barbara L. Bickford, Gerald Clark Blount and Mary Katherine Harris, Frances Tovey and Roy J. Ellsworth, Matthew James and Lori Susan Espe, Jeanette A. Hackney, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Victor H. and Ruth Nay Skiles, Syngenta Crop Protection Inc., and Dennis K. and Debra L. Ujiiye. The university will also welcome 32 new members into the Silver and Gold Society, which recognizes giving of $100,000 to $999,999. The names of the new members have been added to the university’s Legacy of Giving donor recognition display in the Administration Building foyer. For more information on giving to the University of Idaho, visit the Give to Idaho <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=1d5af0ec5d&e=55d7947efc>  website. 

UI Receives Grand Challenges Explorations Grant

The University of Idaho is the recipient of a Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Grand Challenges Explorations initiative grant <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=886842e085&e=55d7947efc> . Haiqing Sheng, a UI research scientist, will pursue an innovative global health and development research project, titled “CRISPR-Cas9 directed bacteriophage treatment of EPEC diarrhea.” The Grand Challenges Explorations (GCE) initiative funds individuals worldwide to explore ideas that can break the mold in how we solve persistent global health and development challenges. Sheng’s project is one of more than 50 Grand Challenges Explorations Round 15 grants announced Thursday by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Disease-causing E. coli bacteria are responsible for more than 30 percent of infant diarrhea cases in South Africa, Kenya, Bangladesh, Brazil and Mexico. Known as the enteropathogenic E. coli, or EPEC, the bacteria cause several hundred thousand childhood deaths per year worldwide. Sheng’s project will explore using probiotics to target the disease-causing E. coli to protect children’s health. 

Lionel Hampton Jazz Fest Announces 2016 Artist Lineup

2015-11-20,FRIDAY LETTER: The Way Forward for a Great Life,"November 20, 2015 	
 <https://gallery.mailchimp.com/e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef/images/78d0092c-6b67-41ab-8113-fb516677185b.jpg> 	
Dear Friends, 	
Last week was a remarkable week for education in Idaho – for our K-12 schools, and for our higher education system. High school seniors across the state, and their parents, received letters of acceptance to Idaho public colleges and universities directly from the State Board of Education, a measure intended to smooth the transition to postsecondary education. The University of Idaho followed up by leading a statewide “Enroll Idaho” initiative, fanning out across Idaho to spread information and awareness about options for life after high school.

At Enroll Idaho on November 10, UI delivered a strong message about the value of going on to higher education to more than 420 students and 330 parents, from Boundary County in the north to Bear Lake County in the southeast and all points in between. I had the pleasure of returning to Grangeville to talk with high school seniors there and then visiting Coeur d’Alene that night.

You’ll find a lot of information about the value of postsecondary attainment in this video <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=a4d22bf856&e=55d7947efc>  we made for the event, but here’s a little bit of what we told people about going on to college: We know that a high-quality college education, the kind you find at UI, is transformative for people’s lives. To be clear, a college degree is not right for everyone. But for many, it is a critical ingredient in the recipe for a great life. Through higher education, students unlock the talent and creativity that inform a life of purpose and initiative. It’s an opportunity to make life-long friends, to see the world, and to grow as a leader.

Students who graduate from college emerge as critical thinkers and problem-solvers, qualities that are in-demand for employers, no matter what field you enter. The lifetime earnings difference among those who have a college degree and those who do not was recently estimated at $830,000 by the Federal Reserve <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=2dfe649c77&e=55d7947efc> , a wide gap this is only getting wider. The great jobs of today and tomorrow increasingly demand a college degree and the skills and perspectives that come with it. Beyond financial stability, though, a well-paying job leads to increased well-being <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=5719bb05fe&e=55d7947efc>  in professional life, in personal satisfaction and in civic engagement. In short, doors open for college graduates – pathways to an exciting future.

Postsecondary education also unleashes a bright future for our state. A vibrant economy starts with an educated workforce, as our economy moves in a knowledge- and information-based direction. Those are the jobs that will build prosperity for our communities, and will provide opportunities for young people ready to start careers and families.

Taking the next steps toward college may seem daunting, but it doesn’t need to be. I encourage students and families to examine resources about how to go to college <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=858ccaab36&e=55d7947efc> , as well as how to assess which institution <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=25d760e718&e=55d7947efc>  and which course of study <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=c89c5c66bd&e=55d7947efc>  is right for them. UI is going to follow up the Enroll Idaho effort with outreach – FAFSA workshops, recruiting events and more – that help us reshape the college-going culture in our state. I encourage students and families to ask questions and explore. We’re here to listen and answer questions. The way forward for a great life may be closer than you think.

P.S. I’ll return with the next Friday Letter on December 4. Continuing an annual tradition, our School of Family and Consumer Sciences students have put together a list of Vandal recipes <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=299880b755&e=55d7947efc>  for Thanksgiving.

Giving Supports Library First-floor Remodel

“We are proud to support all students with our gift to the University Library,” explained Dawn Wittman ’71. She and her husband, Dick ’70, made a gift to support the library’s first floor remodel. The $1.3 million project, scheduled for completion in spring 2016, addresses the demand for technology-rich, collaborative learning spaces. “The Wittmans’ gift recognizes the vital role the library plays in attracting and retaining students,” said Dean Lynn Baird. “Offering students quality learning environments with access to top-rate technology gives them a competitive edge in the workplace. We are very grateful to the Wittmans for their generosity.” Dawn, a member of the UI Library Advisory Board, retired as executive director of the Lewiston City Library in 2012 and was recognized as Idaho’s Librarian of the Year. Dick oversees Wittman Farms Inc. and Wittman Consulting. For information on giving to the University Library, contact Jim Zuba at (208) 885-4142 or jzuba@uidaho.edu <mailto:jzuba@uidaho.edu> .

The University of Idaho is extending the Confluence Project, a program that helps North Idaho high schoolers learn scientific skills while studying water resource issues in their own communities, with a new grant from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The $91,000 environmental education grant <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=ac3c41fe68&e=55d7947efc>  will help the university partner with teachers in Post Falls, Coeur d’Alene, Plummer, Moscow and St. Maries and more than 200 students. This year’s curriculum will include an increased focus on climate change, indigenous knowledge and agriculture. UI was one of just three groups in the Pacific Northwest that received a grant, with 48 applications submitted from EPA Region 10. Launched in 2013, the Confluence Project connects UI graduate students with regional teachers, students and community partners. The high school students learn about local watersheds challenges through projects such as measuring snowpack on Mount Spokane, learning about traditional ecological knowledge from Coeur d’Alene Tribal elders and monitoring river quality at Paradise Creek on the Palouse.

2015-12-04,FRIDAY LETTER: UI Leads the Way in Outdoor Adventure,"December 4, 2015 	
 <https://gallery.mailchimp.com/e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef/images/78d0092c-6b67-41ab-8113-fb516677185b.jpg> 	
Dear Friends, 	
Our state is filled with a remarkable abundance of mountains, canyons, rivers and wide-open spaces. With nearly unlimited opportunities for exploration, there is no better launching pad for educational and inspirational adventure than the University of Idaho. That’s a discovery I’ve been fortunate to make, alongside students, faculty and staff, alumni and community members from across the state.
 
Last week, while many of us were staying warm over turkey and other holiday favorites <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=4d28c548c1&e=55d7947efc> , a UI Outdoor Program <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=1223d46317&e=55d7947efc>  group was braving the elements in the Owyhee Canyonlands in southwest Idaho. The 10 hardy souls — students, student leaders, program staff, an alumnus and a visiting professor — hiked and camped throughout this new wilderness area in a remote part of the state, exploring the sagebrush steppes and the austere river canyons. The multi-day trip was one of many “Iconic Idaho” recreational opportunities through our Outdoor Program that showcase the unique and diverse natural splendor of Idaho. The 40-year-old Outdoor Program office at UI, led by Director Trevor Fulton, is nationally recognized <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=31f70aa62d&e=55d7947efc> . You couldn’t ask for a better guide to Idaho’s wild spaces.
 
Those programs do more than offer recreation, though. They help students build a foundation of technical skills that they can apply to future endeavors. They offer opportunities for students to practice leadership. Student leaders work with staff to plan and execute trips, helping others cultivate a passion for the outdoors. Other skill development includes problem-solving, critical thinking and good decision-making. Not all student participants are recreation majors; in fact, many if not most are pursuing other disciplines, from business to engineering and more. Faculty members, UI staff, and alumni can also participate in trips.
 
It’s important to dispel a few myths when discussing our Outdoor Programs. First, none of us are born adventurers or explorers, so most of the programs are designed to serve the absolute beginner while still offering value to more experienced participants. Affordability is another concern, no doubt. But whether it’s a trip or the rental of equipment from our well-stocked Outdoor Rental Center <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=65d3cb9ba1&e=55d7947efc>  — one of the largest such rental shops in the country — the Outdoor Programs office runs on a strictly non-profit basis, with costs that students will find within their reach. (A simple overnight trip might be $25, and a weeklong trip under $200, for instance.)
 
I bring up that commitment to accessibility and affordability because I know that students and other adults might find pursuing new skills and experiences — whether it’s skiing, kayaking, backcountry camping and more — a little daunting. But pushing yourself with new experiences is what higher education is all about. There is more to college than what you’ll find between the walls of a classroom or laboratory. Taking a facilitated trip, renting equipment to explore on your own, or even just using the climbing wall <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=c5bfcf769f&e=55d7947efc>  at the Student Recreation Center are great ways to relieve stress and begin developing into the person you want to be, physically and mentally. It’s all part of a well-rounded college experience.
 
We have another holiday coming up, and a winter break. Want a break from cabin fever? The Student Recreation Center is open, with many opportunities for families and community members. Climb a wall. Tune up a pair of skis. Learn more about a winter or spring trip with Outdoor Programs — sign-up begins the first day of spring semester. Get out and discover this great state we’re lucky and proud to call home.

1941 Alumna Keeps Physically and Fiscally Fit

Dr. Lucille Pederson Hardgrove, age 95, goes to the gym every day to keep physically fit. A resident of Michigan, Lucille was featured on TV news <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=2aab329a99&e=55d7947efc>  for visiting the gym last summer in Roanoke, Virginia, while visiting her brother. Lucille also makes wise choices when it comes to keeping fiscally fit. She makes her annual gift to UI with appreciated stock <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=8d33f79888&e=55d7947efc> . Her gift to UI allows her to take an income tax deduction for the full value of the stock and avoid paying tax on the capital gain. This year, Lucille’s gift went to the Jerard M. Pederson Scholarship Endowment in the College of Engineering in memory of her late husband, Jerry (’42 Civil Engineering). Because Jerry was a GE retiree, Lucille’s gift is matched <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=5445ab2035&e=55d7947efc>  by the GE Foundation, thereby doubling the impact for engineering students at the university — another wise fiscal move.

UI Names New Director of the Integrated Design Lab in Boise

The University of Idaho has named Elizabeth Cooper the new director <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=bc31534f0c&e=55d7947efc>  of the College of Art and Architecture’s Integrated Design Lab (IDL) <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=2774c4eced&e=55d7947efc>  based at UI Boise. Cooper is also an associate professor of architecture. She started in her new role in October, having served as the interim director of the IDL since June 21, 2015. The Integrated Design Laboratory provides building owners, architects and engineers with design education technical design assistance, research, resources and other services to promote the development of high-performance, sustainable buildings in Idaho and Eastern Oregon. Design teams that utilize the resources available through the IDL will design buildings that are more comfortable for people, require less energy to maintain and operate, and enhance the health and productivity of their inhabitants.

“My vision for the University of Idaho Integrated Design Lab is to build upon the solid foundation of energy efficiency research and to expand the definition of high performance buildings to include human health, water resources, and integration into the site and community while fostering an atmosphere of collegiality in which exploration and creativity is encouraged,” Cooper said.

2015-12-11,FRIDAY LETTER: Vandal Excellence – There’s an App for That,"December 11, 2015 	
 <https://gallery.mailchimp.com/e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef/images/78d0092c-6b67-41ab-8113-fb516677185b.jpg> 	
Dear Friends, 	
This week nearly 700 Vandals <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=12f08cb22e&e=55d7947efc>  approach the commencement stage as students, cross it as graduates and leave it as proud, degree-holding members of the Vandal family. Students have earned degrees at the baccalaureate, master’s, doctoral and specialist levels, across a broad spectrum of disciplines, as you’d expect from a comprehensive research university like ours. It’s another chapter in the story of the University of Idaho, one written by each student — in some cases, literally.
 
I have presided over a few of these ceremonies now, but it is still rewarding to see students achieve a goal for which they worked long and hard. If you’ve attended commencement, you might be familiar with the train of graduates, segmented by college, that enters the building at the start of the ceremony — a processional. The banner for each college is held by what we refer to as a highlight student, a graduate who has demonstrated the diligence, initiative and expertise to represent his or her college. I congratulate these students on their accomplishments.
 
As one example of this Vandal excellence, the processional highlight student for the College of Natural Resources is rangeland ecology and management major Justin Trujillo. Justin is a non-traditional student who came to UI to complete his bachelor’s degree and further his career. During his time with the Rangeland Center <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=ee6200b6dd&e=55d7947efc> , he noticed that there was no field guide for grasses. Instead of waiting for someone else to make one, he spent his undergraduate career taking photos, finding the funding and working with others to create a reference book.
 
In this day and age, of course, a book needs to find a way to fit on our phones, so Justin is now working with a partner to build a phone app. Picture hiking in Idaho, and being able to identify pieces of the diverse landscape around you, with just a glance down at your phone. Landowners, management professionals and recreational users can all benefit. That breakthrough is a testament to problem-solving, teamwork and leadership.
 
It’s also proof positive of what a college experience can do. Vandals crossing the stage today have exercised similar initiative in countless settings, in the classroom and outside of it. They’ve opened their minds to new ideas, and engaged in hands-on research, scholarly activity and creative work alongside expert professors. They’ve practiced discipline and honed the self-efficacy that will guide them in their careers. They’ve learned about issues and concerns outside of their own interests, giving back to communities <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=1876bc5416&e=55d7947efc>  near and far through service.
 
I know our students will take those experiences with them after tomorrow. They’ll contribute their skills and passion to making the world a better place — indeed, they already have.

Three UI Students Earn Gilman Scholarships

Three students from the University of Idaho have been selected to receive the Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholarship <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=0c95f6d0a3&e=55d7947efc> , sponsored by the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, to study or intern abroad during the 2015-16 academic term. Clarisa Lopez of Burley, and Joshua Warnick and Tyler Mitchell of Coeur d’Alene, will be studying in France, Morocco and Japan, respectively. Gilman scholars receive up to $5,000 to apply toward their study abroad or internship program costs. The program aims to diversify the students who study and intern abroad and the countries and regions where they go. Scholarship recipients have the opportunity to gain a better understanding of other cultures, countries, languages and economies — making them better prepared to assume leadership roles within government and the private sector. The program is administered by the Institute of International Education. 

Borah Symposium Dates and Theme Announced

The University of Idaho’s Borah Foundation, located in the College of Letters, Arts and Social Sciences, has announced the date and theme for the 2016 Borah Symposium <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=a3a27fac3c&e=55d7947efc> . This year’s event runs Monday, April 4 through Wednesday, April 6, 2016, and will discuss “Waging Peace.” The annual Borah Symposium strives to bring together world leaders, diplomats, scholars, activists and our local communities to discuss the causes of war and the conditions for peace. The three-day symposium will focus on humanitarian action in the 21st century, kicking off on Monday, April 4, with a panel discussion on refugees. Human-rights activist and best-selling author John Prendergast will speak on Tuesday, April 5. For the first time, the Borah Symposium will also be holding programs in Boise. Samantha Nutt, founder and executive director of War Child Canada, will speak at Borah High School in Boise on April 5. On Wednesday, April 6, Nutt will give the symposium’s keynote address in Moscow.

2016-01-08,FRIDAY LETTER: New Report Showcases UI’s Economic Impact,"January 8, 2016 	
 <https://gallery.mailchimp.com/e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef/images/78d0092c-6b67-41ab-8113-fb516677185b.jpg> 	
Dear Friends, 	
Welcome to an exciting new year with the University of Idaho. Our family vacationed together, but I am glad to be back in Moscow, rested and ready for a great semester. I often speak to students about the value of a college degree in financial and personal terms, urging them to invest in themselves. Early in the New Year, I’ll speak to committees of the Idaho Legislature, and I’ll urge them to invest in the University of Idaho, as a way to ensure and enhance its many economic and societal benefits.

I’d like to begin 2016 by sharing a new report by Economic Modeling Specialists International (EMSI) <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=9c643cd31a&e=55d7947efc> , a leader in economic modeling based in Moscow, showing just how much UI contributes to the economic well-being of Idaho. The EMSI report gives us a global view of the university, showing that UI’s economic impact is varied and far-ranging. The university generates economic activity through research that benefits industry, through operations across the state and through delivering a transformative education to students. Our new report shows a strong surge in total annual impact – $1.1 billion. That amounts to 1.9 percent of Idaho’s economy, as measured by Gross State Product (GSP).

What specifically drives this impact? Operations spending, including our 3,000 full- and part-time employees, is a part of the story, as is research spending. However, the majority of the impact, some $782 million, comes from Vandal alumni. That is the direct result of former students taking their skills, perspectives and experience to Idaho employers. Vandal graduates are earning higher wages courtesy of their UI degree, they are helping businesses reach new levels of output, and they are putting more money from those higher wages back into the economy.

To understand the university’s impact in this way is essentially to assess our role in workforce development. That’s a key part of what we do as an institution, and this report shows that our performance should give us a lot of pride. Creating opportunities for students to live up to their potential and contribute to organizations and communities across the state is the central piece of UI’s economic impact. It’s also at the heart of our land-grant mission. While there is more to the university than a dollars and cents analysis shows, we should be pleased that the leadership and commitment that is our heritage and our future can be so convincingly demonstrated in economic terms.

The University of Idaho, our state’s public, land-grant institution, offers outstanding return on investment. For students, the increase in lifetime earnings they’ll see with their degree is more than $844,200, an impressive 14 percent annual rate of return. For taxpayers considering the merits of supporting our public university, consider that “for every $1 of public money invested in UI, taxpayers receive a cumulative value of $2.40 over the course of the students’ working lives.” The annual return rate taxpayers will realize is 8.2 percent, “a solid investment that compares favorably with other long-term investments in both the private and public sectors.” Lastly, one must consider the social perspective of having more educated citizens – better health, less crime and more employment. These social savings and added income pay off for the state many times over the initial investment.

Graduates of the University of Idaho know well how their lives were changed. I have met many who have described the new perspectives, attitudes and maturity forged at UI that shaped who they are today. For Vandals, it’s about more than dollars and cents. But we shouldn’t shy away from touting the economic benefits the university brings to citizens and to the state as a whole. In fact, I think that for too long we’ve undersold our critical role in workforce development and in the economy.

Our public university is not an expense, nor is it a luxury. It is an investment, and an absolutely critical foundation for prosperity. We will work hard to strengthen that foundation in the year ahead.

Teaching the Spirit of Giving Back

You’ve probably heard a number of the inspiring stories of alumni, but you may not know that many current students also give back to the University of Idaho. Wil Everly, the UI Student Foundation President, has worked during his two-year tenure to raise student awareness of the importance of philanthropy to the success of the University of Idaho. Each year the Student Foundation encourages graduating seniors to make a Senior Class Gift (this year $20.16), providing students an opportunity to give back to a scholarship or program that inspired them while they were here. “It’s a great way to say ‘Thank You’ and start a tradition of giving back to the UI,” said Everly. For more information on the Student Foundation at the University of Idaho, contact James Brownson, director of Annual Giving, at (208) 885-5369 or jbrownson@uidaho.edu <mailto:jbrownson@uidaho.edu> . 

Yee Family Celebrates Idaho Connections with Two Gifts

To honor his family and his memories of UI, Boyd Yee ’67 has given two recent gifts to the university. Yee recently created the Boyd Yee and Daisy Nebeker Yee Family Endowment in the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences. “During the last few years, I have been an enthusiastic donor to the Steer-A-Year program headed by Carl Hunt,” said Yee. “This friendship and participation with UI Extension has led to the creation of my endowment and is a way to honor my late wife of 39 years, Daisy.” Yee also donated a valuable Chinese-American artifact and family heirloom, the “Kang Youwei Board,” to the UI Asian American Comparative Collection. Boyd’s father, a Chinese herbalist, previously used the board in his Boise shop. Boyd, who worked for the Bureau of Land Management for 25 years before retiring, currently owns a cow/calf operation and raises quality hay.

UI Students Honored in Design Contest

Three University of Idaho architecture students were awarded top honors <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=b7becc242a&e=55d7947efc>  in a “Best Use of Idaho Wood” competition to design a hypothetical marketplace in Moscow, Idaho. The projects were judged on how their designs demonstrated a creative solution and knowledgeable application of integrated design and an innovative use of wood. Caleb Ehly of Sandpoint won the competition and received a first place plaque and $500. William Juarez of Filer and Nick Buckley of Boise earned merit awards for second and third place designs and each received plaques and $250. Ehly’s elegant winning design used five native Idaho woods: Douglas fir for Glulam beams in tension as the main support; lodgepole pine as rigid structure; western hemlock for flooring and finish; ponderosa pine for finishing, trim and detail; and western red cedar harvested from burned forest for charcoaled siding. This is the fourth year the Idaho Forest Products Commission has sponsored a Best Use of Idaho Wood competition to urge professional and student architects to encourage, recognize and support the creative and innovative use of Idaho wood in architectural design. 

Pave the Road with Silver and Gold

The University of Idaho Office of Alumni Relations is encouraging all alumni, friends and business owners to help create a Vandal-colored path to Moscow for all those students and their families visiting UI in April for our UIdaho Bound enrollment events <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=b68c93d7db&e=55d7947efc> . Hundreds of future Vandals will be traveling to Moscow for the April 2 and 23 events, and we want to show them just how vast and proud our network of alumni and friends is. Help us Pave the Road Silver and Gold by flying your Vandal colors around these dates. Know of alumni or business owners along the major routes to Moscow who would like to participate in Pave the Road, or need more details?

2016-01-15,FRIDAY LETTER: Making the Grade on the College Scorecard,"January 15, 2016 	
 <https://gallery.mailchimp.com/e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef/images/78d0092c-6b67-41ab-8113-fb516677185b.jpg> 	
Dear Friends, 	
Many of you have likely witnessed the proliferation of yearly college rankings, ratings and lists, all purporting to add information and insight. Instead of clarification, however, confusion is often the result. Why is an institution ranked in the top 50 of one list, but not in the top 50 of another, similar list? What methodologies are being employed, and how do they differ from list to list? What metrics are valuable for which user? As a student or parent, you’d almost have to make a part time job of sorting out and verifying competing claims and distinctions.

That shouldn’t be the case, and it doesn’t have to be. I have found that the federal government’s new College Scorecard <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=4408a74353&e=55d7947efc>  report offers clarity, based on credible data, about three critical measures: affordability for students and families, graduation rates, and earnings after college. The first measure, affordability, indicates the degree of access to a transformative education. The second and third measures, graduation rates and earnings, highlight two of the most important outcomes of a college experience.

For students, for families, and for taxpaying citizens of the state of Idaho, these three measures get to the heart of the matter: Are we serving students and our public well? At the University of Idaho, the answer is a resounding yes. Look at the public, four-year universities in Idaho. UI’s average net cost is the lowest in the state, with the lowest net cost among all four-year public institutions for families with annual income under $48,000 per year. Our six-year graduation rate is the highest in the state. And for a UI graduate, earnings 10 years after graduation are much higher than other institutions. (UI fares similarly well when compared with private institutions.) In each measure, we outperform the national average.

These easy-to-read charts showcase UI’s delivery of an excellent education at an affordable price – a value for our students and for our state.

Beyond those comparisons, the scorecard offers a breakdown of University of Idaho performance on a number of valuable measures. Interested in freshman-to-sophomore retention as an indicator of “fit” and student support? Our retention rate is 79 percent, above the national average. (For Fall 2015, our data shows an increase to 80 percent.) Concerned about debt after college? UI students who take on debt successfully pay it down at rates well above the national average. I encourage students and families to explore the site, make comparisons, and assess what’s important for their individual and family circumstances. We welcome the scrutiny.

Importantly, the data are based on students who received federal financial aid. That means those students who need and receive support in attaining a college degree – including many first-generation college attendees and students from rural areas – receive an outstanding return on their investment from UI. These students will experience firsthand how UI contributes to social mobility <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=be0e0301e5&e=55d7947efc> . They will go on to lives with greater financial stability, with greater satisfaction <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=282dde61a2&e=55d7947efc>  at work and in their personal endeavors, and with stronger rates of civic engagement. They will, in short, be on a pathway to realizing the American Dream. 

The College Scorecard showcases how the University of Idaho is focused on making an outstanding education accessible to more Idaho students. For other Idaho citizens, UI supporters and education professionals, insight into how their state’s leading, national research university is performing with taxpayer dollars is a down payment toward credibility and confidence. For affordability, for graduation rates and for success after college, UI stands out in Idaho and across the region.

Supporting the UI through the VSF

Studies have shown that successful athletic programs lead to enrollment growth, positive student experiences, and higher levels of alumni involvement. Attorney and alumnus Robie G. Russell ’78 of Bainbridge Island, Washington, aims to help the University of Idaho’s athletic programs achieve success through his support of the Vandal Scholarship Fund <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=5bc3c6c9c0&e=55d7947efc> . Russell gives $10,000 annually to the VSF, which pays the tuition costs for student-athletes. “College sports provide a valuable marketing tool for the university,” said Russell. “I feel a sense of duty and obligation to give back to my alma mater, so that others may experience what I did here.” In addition to his financial contributions, Russell has also donated countless hours serving as a member and past president of the VSF national board, member and past president of Ada County VSF, member of the Latah County VSF, and current member of the Puget Sound VSF. For more information on giving to the VSF, contact Tim Mooney at (208) 885-0258 or tmooney@uidaho.edu <mailto:tmooney@uidaho.edu> . 

McClure Center Study Examines Go-On Rate

Results of a new University of Idaho study shed light on why nearly half of Idaho’s high school graduates do not go immediately on to postsecondary education. The statewide survey, “Life after High School,” <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=3c1690e776&e=55d7947efc>  will help higher education leaders across the state better understand why Idaho continues to fall at or near the bottom of all states for college “go on” rates. The study demonstrates the university’s mission to understand and meet the needs of the state’s residents. “This new study is a valuable resource that will help our state understand the challenges we face in promoting postsecondary attendance,” Staben said. “We are deeply invested in addressing this issue, and this study gives us up-to-date information to create effective policy and guide decision-making, as one key part of continuing to build an educated and prosperous Idaho.” 

UI Opens New Cybersecurity Training Center

It sounds like a state-of-the-art burrow in a Tom Clancy techno thriller – the Cybersecurity Training and Operations Center. Instead, it’s a new extension of the University of Idaho inside the college’s Post Falls research park. Here, aspiring computer security experts can prepare and test for their professional certifications, and employees in the field can pursue on-the-job training. In addition, a laboratory will use simulated cyberattacks as a training tool, and area businesses can learn how vulnerable they are to a security breach and what to do about it.

“It’s like a command center, an air traffic control room,” said Karen Thurston, the center’s director and head of Emerging Technology Business Development at UI. The professional development and technical education program is a response to the escalation of cybercrime targeting companies and organizations, and a growing demand for cybersecurity experts.

2016-01-22,FRIDAY LETTER: An Investment We Can’t Afford Not To Make,"January 22, 2016 	
 <https://gallery.mailchimp.com/e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef/images/78d0092c-6b67-41ab-8113-fb516677185b.jpg> 	
Dear Friends, 	
Next week I will present the University of Idaho’s budget priorities before committees of the Idaho Legislature, sharing the story of our success and how we can build on that excellence. As our state’s land-grant institution, UI conducts teaching and learning, research and discovery, and outreach and Extension. Our ability to meet these responsibilities with effectiveness and strong fiscal stewardship means that public support of the University of Idaho is a sound investment in a great future.
 
What do we mean by “investment”? The economic impact report <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=3556778654&e=55d7947efc>  I shared two weeks ago offers some insight. Across the board, UI delivers return on investment <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=930228b040&e=55d7947efc>  for our students, our citizens and our state. The report convincingly demonstrates that higher education is not a luxury, and it is not an expense. It is the foundation for our shared prosperity. At the legislature, I will explore the success of previous years of investments, and make the case for programs and initiatives that will allow us to do more.
 
Last week, Governor Otter offered his budget recommendations <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=e329d6c1b4&e=55d7947efc>  as part of the State of the State Address. Though not directive, these recommendations often form the basis of legislative appropriations. The governor’s budget includes an increase in the Opportunity Scholarship, a new Completion Scholarship and an innovative Tuition Lock program.  These programs offer ways to expand access to higher education. The tuition lock program provides stability and predictability for Idaho students and families, and it is philosophically consistent with commitments we have made as a university to ensure access and affordability.
 
The Governor also recommended a change in employee compensation of 3 percent, which will help us remain competitive in attracting and retaining outstanding educators and researchers, essential to the excellence of the student experience and our ability to do great work for Idaho.
 
Specific UI requests focus on enhancing our teaching and research missions. Our Complete College Idaho: Go On initiative bolsters the advising, counseling and supplemental instruction that helps students succeed in college. The effort will help ensure on-time graduation and improved student retention. On each of those measures, UI is the state’s leader among public institutions, but expanded capacity means we can set the bar higher.
 
The Governor also recommended five additional seats and increased funding for Idaho WWAMI — Idaho’s medical school. Through the Idaho WWAMI program, aspiring physicians from our state receive training in partnership with one of the best medical programs in the country, the national leader in family and rural medicine. With a shortage of physicians across our state, especially in rural areas, we’re fortunate to have a partnership that sees more than 50 percent of Idaho students return home to Idaho communities to practice medicine. Funding the Idaho WWAMI program is a much-needed investment in the health and well-being of our state.
 
As a comprehensive research university, we have other areas of need for which I’ll advocate. Those needs include maintenance and operation funds for facilities, such as our new Aquaculture Research Institute laboratory that delivers research expertise for our state’s world-class trout industry and hands-on learning for students, and for the new Integrated Research and Innovation Center (IRIC) that will propel interdisciplinary problem-solving and discovery for all of Idaho. We advocated for, and the Governor recommended, investments in our Idaho Geological Survey, in Forest Utilization Research, and in agricultural research that support the backbone of Idaho’s economy.
 
We appreciate the governor’s recognition of the excellence these initiatives help our university achieve, and how they help our state meet its short- and long-term goals for success and prosperity. The legislative process is a long process that usually culminates in March, but our first steps are promising.

UI Highest in PayScale College Salary Report

The 2015-2016 PayScale College Salary Report <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=711d22519c&e=55d7947efc>  marks the University of Idaho as the top school in Idaho for graduate earnings and as a top school among other regional institutions. Understanding earnings potential helps students choose a school that will be an investment in their long-term financial security and that will spur opportunities to find personally meaningful careers. University of Idaho alumni earn the highest salaries early career and mid-career salaries of graduates from any public four-year institution in Idaho. UI awards the highest percentage of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) degrees in the state, and graduates report a high degree of meaning in their professional lives. Among Idaho public and private four-year institutions, only BYU-Idaho records higher early career salaries, though Vandal grads in mid-career earn more. One PayScale list compares those with only a bachelor’s degree, and another compares those with a master’s degree. On each list, UI and Vandal graduates lead the way in Idaho and fare very well in the region.  

Pilot Program Brings Diverse Students to UI Law

The University of Idaho College of Law is one of four law schools around the nation participating in a new program <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=155bcdbe80&e=55d7947efc>  aimed at increasing diversity among law professionals. Created by the Council on Legal Education Opportunity (CLEO), the Legally Inspired Cohort (CLIC) is a pilot program that will recruit individuals from a range of backgrounds and offer continuous academic, financial and other support services through their first year of law study. The College of Law’s entering juris doctor (JD) Class of 2015 is 41 percent female, 59 percent male and 16 percent multicultural. As one of the four partners in this pilot program, the college will prepare even more historically underrepresented minorities, economically disadvantaged individuals, and first-generation college students to attend law school and succeed in the legal profession. Students accepted to the program will receive a $5,000 out-of-state tuition waiver from the UI College of Law and $500 from CLEO to cover enrollment costs. Each student studying at UI will also be assigned a third-year law student as a mentor.

2016-01-29,FRIDAY LETTER: Medical Education in Idaho,"January 29, 2016 	
 <https://gallery.mailchimp.com/e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef/images/78d0092c-6b67-41ab-8113-fb516677185b.jpg> 	
Dear Friends, 	
I would like to share some information on a complex issue: medical education in Idaho. Providing medical professionals to ensure the health of our citizens is an important educational mission. Healthcare encompasses many professions: physicians, nurses, pharmacists, physical therapists and more. This letter will focus on physician training or the medical doctorate (M.D.), in which UI plays a critical role. Understanding how medical education is delivered is necessary for making informed decisions about the future of such programs in Idaho – planning for smart and sustained growth.

The WWAMI program <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=1875c93dbe&e=55d7947efc>  is the primary MD training program in Idaho. WWAMI stands for “Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho” – a partnership between the state of Washington, its top-rated medical school at the University of Washington, and the four, more sparsely populated nearby states that do not have their own public medical schools. Through this program, Idaho students receive the M.D. degree from the University of Washington, nationally ranked No. 1 for primary care, No. 1 for family medicine, No. 1 for rural medicine, and highly ranked in many specialties and in research.

For three decades, Idaho had 20 WWAMI seats. Last year, that number rose to 35 Idaho students. And this year, UI requested state funds to enroll 40 students in the Idaho WWAMI program. That growth has contributed to success for students and to a healthier state.

Physician training is long, complex and requires a system of universities, medical schools and residency programs. An excellent resource from which I will draw much of my data is the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) 2015 State Physician Workforce Data Book <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=09942dfb68&e=55d7947efc>  and related material on their website.

Preparation for Medical School – 4 years
Most aspiring physicians begin preparation for medical education as undergraduates in a bachelor’s degree program. Few colleges offer pre-medical majors, and prospective medical students may complete any degree program provided the requisite coursework in chemistry, biology, mathematics, physics and English is successfully completed before admission. Just over half of all students entering medical school in 2015 had completed a biology major, but many other majors are represented. All of Idaho’s four-year institutions offer appropriate prerequisite coursework for applying to medical school.

Medical School – 4 years
Physicians may hold an MD or Doctor of Osteopathy (D.O.) degree. As the degree that designates entry into the medical profession, these degree programs are considered Undergraduate Medical Education among medical schools, an often confusing term for a professional degree that follows bachelor’s degree attainment. Traditionally, medical school was a four-year educational curriculum that began with foundational basic sciences, and then introduced clinical experiences in hospitals and doctor’s offices as the curriculum progressed. Increasingly, new curricular approaches are integrating clinical work throughout training, requiring medical schools to have access to clinicians and clinical sites to permit such experiences.

Residency Training – 3-6 years
After completing an MD or DO program, almost all physicians pursue Graduate Medical Education, commonly referred to as residency training, for the purpose of establishing a specialty. Primary care residencies (Family Medicine, Internal Medicine, and Pediatrics) are typically three years of intense clinical experience in supervised settings. Other specialties, such as surgery or radiology, are typically six years and require even more specialized supervision. Many residencies are at academic medical centers, but they can also be at community hospitals. Idaho has residencies in Family Medicine based in Boise, Coeur d’Alene and Pocatello; in Internal Medicine in Boise; and in Psychiatry in Boise.

Physician Workforce Needs
The AAMC is concerned that current physician training may not produce enough doctors to meet the United States needs in the 21st century. AAMC data clearly indicate that Idaho’s physician pipeline is very limited, which is why the University of Idaho has been working hard to increase physician training on multiple fronts.

Idaho ranks 49th in physicians per capita. We have less than 20 percent of the national average of medical residents per capita, and reasonable estimates of medical students from Idaho – enrolled in programs across the U.S. – indicate that our state enrolls Idahoans in medical school at less than half the per capita national average. Idaho students applying to medical school are well-qualified, with MCAT test scores and grade point averages very similar to national peers, and they are admitted at rates similar to all premedical students.

In sum, for its population, Idaho has a low number of practicing physicians and a small, but growing MD production pipeline. While we strengthen that pipeline, we can continue building upon the Idaho WWAMI program’s strengths and expanding capacity.

The University of Idaho’s Current Role
The University of Idaho plays important roles at all three stages of the physician pipeline. It is not certain how many UI students attend medical school after graduation, but we know that about 10 percent of all WWAMI students studied at UI. Clearly, UI plays an important role in pre-medical (bachelor’s degree) education, one we plan to expand.

Second, the centerpiece of UI’s role in medical education is the Idaho WWAMI program. In this program, Idaho students, no matter where they attended undergraduate education, access the UW School of Medicine via the University of Idaho. They complete their first 18 months of physician training in Moscow and surrounding rural communities, facilitated by UI faculty and area physicians. That experience is followed by clinical clerkships in 178 locations across Idaho and other WWAMI states. Students then complete an eight-week clinical rotation in one of the University of Washington’s highly specialized quaternary care hospitals, and may choose clinical rotations throughout the WWAMI network. Fortunately, most Idaho WWAMI students complete the bulk of their MD training in Idaho.

Last, WWAMI graduates, like most physicians, will complete residencies before practicing. WWAMI staff play an integral role for the residencies in Idaho. Residency is often the primary determinant of where a physician will practice. We are fortunate that despite the limited residency opportunities currently available within the state, 51 percent of all Idaho WWAMI graduates have practiced or are practicing in Idaho.

I hope you see that the challenge of educating, attracting and retaining Idaho’s 21st-century physician workforce is a complex one. The University of Idaho is pleased to have a world-class partner in the University of Washington to help us meet that challenge, and we are proud to have rapidly increased the number of students admitted to pursue physician training.

We have a long history and exciting future in training Idaho’s next generation of physicians. We need to work collaboratively to find solutions for access to medical education. Together, we can overcome our state’s healthcare challenges and lead Idaho to a healthier tomorrow.

Gifts of Global Competency and Understanding

The Department of Modern Languages and Cultures in the College of Letters, Arts and Social Sciences (CLASS) connects University of Idaho students with a diverse and rapidly evolving world. Two recent leadership-level gifts will help to greatly accelerate this critical work. Recently, Richard ’73 and Barbara ’73 Dahl created the Barbara K. Dahl Endowment for Language Immersion to fund in-country language education for students studying abroad, and John Wallace ’78 created the Wallace Faculty Award in Modern Languages and Cultures to support high-quality instruction and leadership in the department. “Working together, these two extraordinarily generous gifts will ensure that our students will have the global skills and understanding to pursue life-changing work around the globe,” said Andrew Kersten, Dean of CLASS. Contact Peter Mundt, director of development, regarding giving opportunities in CLASS at (208) 885-5013 or peter@uidaho.edu <mailto:peter@uidaho.edu> . 

UI Scores High for Social Mobility

On the 2015 Social Mobility Index <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=176e683574&e=55d7947efc> , the University of Idaho outperformed other public Idaho institutions. The ranking compares the extent to which a university helps financially disadvantaged students graduate into well-paying jobs. Affordable tuition, percentage of low-income students, graduation rates and alumni earnings all inform the rankings. UI was No. 113 nationwide, the highest score in Idaho, aided by its tops-in-the-state graduation rate and impressive median early-career salaries, the highest among public institutions. The top ranking marks the University of Idaho’s commitment to making an affordable education accessible to as many qualified Idaho students as possible. 

UI Offers New Higher Education Doctoral Degree

Professionals working in higher education can maximize their potential to influence change and promote their institution through a new doctorate program <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=abc83f19ff&e=55d7947efc>  offered by the University of Idaho. The Leadership in Higher Education doctorate specialization through the College of Education is an advanced degree program meant for working professionals who want to further their leadership role. “This is the program where participants create networks of colleagues whose passions intersect, one where they meet and interact with leaders in place and where they become colleagues fully informed on the trends, policies, law and possibilities of today’s campuses,” said Cori Mantle-Bromley, dean of the College of Education. The four-year program will launch its inaugural cohort in summer 2016. Core topics in the curriculum include law and ethics, organizational development and change, finance and budgeting, social justice, contemporary issues, stewardship and governance and policy. Courses are primarily online with some in-person commitments required where students will interact with faculty members, peers and professionals in leadership positions.

2016-02-05,FRIDAY LETTER: North Idaho Is Vandal Country,"February 5, 2016 	
 <https://gallery.mailchimp.com/e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef/images/78d0092c-6b67-41ab-8113-fb516677185b.jpg> 	
Dear Friends, 	
The University of Idaho is unique among colleges and universities in our state in that our teaching, research and outreach touch every corner of Idaho. From Priest Lake to Bear Lake, from Preston to Ponderay, and from Idaho Falls to Boise and beyond, Idaho is our campus. North Idaho, especially, is Vandal country. Our Coeur d’Alene center <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=8577a3f11e&e=55d7947efc>  offers opportunities for students, outreach that meets community needs, and workforce development that trains citizens for the jobs of today — and tomorrow.

The Coeur d’Alene center, located on the banks of the Spokane River not far from downtown, is a growing hub for outstanding educational experiences, including a complement of certificate options and bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral degrees. Many offerings, such as our Executive MBA program, are ideal for adults seeking to continue their educations while working. The physical landscape of higher education in Coeur d’Alene is changing to meet new growth, as a new joint-use building in collaboration with NIC and LCSC will bolster support services and help students get the most from their experiences.

The Coeur d’Alene center actively develops entrepreneurship and innovation. At our Post Falls Research Park <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=a367fbb343&e=55d7947efc> , an emerging business incubator, we connect great ideas with the resources they need to accomplish big goals. North Idaho is embracing industries of the future, including cybersecurity. UI-CDA recently won a two-year state workforce training grant and has added private-sector support to launch the Cybersecurity Training and Operations Center <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=a273a9e32c&e=55d7947efc> . The Post Falls center will train the next generation of in-demand employees to succeed in a risk-filled online world, helping them secure a bright future in a thriving sector of our economy. Cybersecurity is an emerging area of excellence at UI, and this center leverages that expertise for the entire community.

The Coeur d’Alene center also promotes tech savvy through the “Dign’IT” program, which includes coding camps for young people, a summer technology internship program for high school students, and STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts and math) labs for all age levels. UI-CDA houses the Idaho Regional Math Center, focusing on teacher professional development; a nonprofit leadership program; and a Community Water Resource Center that partners with experts and community members on water quality, research and education. The sponsorship of a community makerspace, Gizmo-CDA, rounds out our multi-faceted commitment to supporting the interests and needs of the community.

We’re lucky to have Charles Buck, associate vice president at the center, coordinating how we serve North Idaho from the center and from Moscow. He has built valuable relationships in the community, including taking a leadership role with CDA 2030, a collaborative project that helps groups and organizations work toward a common vision for a flourishing city. That work is a great example of the imaginative engagement our centers can bring to a community.

As in areas throughout the state, UI research and outreach and Extension are exploring solutions to complex problems and helping meet community needs. Research on water and natural resources continues to be important. In each of our Extension offices across the region, 4-H and other youth development programs continue to help young people grow as leaders and thinkers.

North Idaho is beautiful country. It’s also an area bustling with promise and opportunity. In the heart of Vandal country, UI is helping shape a bright future.

College of Education Dean Makes Gift to Building Project

Cori Mantle-Bromley (’86 M.Ed, ’90 Ph.D), dean of the College of Education, and her husband, Keith Bromley, have pledged $15,000 toward the $19 million remodel of the College of Education building. Since beginning her tenure as dean in July 2010, Mantle-Bromley has experienced firsthand the power of private support by meeting with hundreds of donors. “I am humbled and inspired by the generosity and care of the most wonderful alumni and friends imaginable,” she said. As a Vandal and the academic leader of the college, Mantle-Bromley also felt strongly that she should make a personal investment. Her husband Keith, a retired educator, strongly supported the idea of a multi-year commitment toward the project which will offer a state-of-the-art facility to house expanded programs and offer UI’s students the best education possible. Mantle-Bromley will retire in June 2016. For more information on supporting the building renovation or the College of Education, contact Marta McClintock at (208) 885-7476 or martam@uidaho.edu <mailto:martam@uidaho.edu> . 

UI Named Top College by The Princeton Review

The University of Idaho is the only Idaho higher education institution <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=1907f9f070&e=55d7947efc>  on The Princeton Review’s new list of the nation’s 200 “Top Colleges that Pay You Back.” The list is based on academic excellence, affordability and career prospects after graduation. Among public colleges and universities in the Northwest, only the University of Washington also made the list. The Princeton Review’s methodology includes the use of institutional and student surveys combined with PayScale’s alumni earnings data. Financial aid is an important component of the analysis — UI awarded more than $24 million in financial aid to students in fall 2015. According to The Princeton Review <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=40805e4f6e&e=55d7947efc> , “Students who attend these schools don't have to mortgage their futures to pay for their degrees—and we believe they will graduate with great career prospects.” The rankings also reflect student opinions of teaching quality and the accessibility of professors. The Princeton Review concludes, “We strongly recommend and salute the colleges we present here for all that they do to help their students with need afford to attend them while delivering an amazing college experience that's worth every penny.” 

UI Researchers Help Address Wildfire Research

The United States must make preparing for and adapting to wildfire a top national priority, says a team of University of Idaho researchers and their international partners in a new paper in the journal BioScience <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=f9de0fcc58&e=55d7947efc> . The researchers issued a call for academia, government agencies, industries and communities to work together to address wildfire because it is a “wicked problem” — one so complex that a one-size-fits-all solution does not exist. “We need to help communities understand how to coexist with wildfire,” said lead author Alistair Smith, fire ecology and management program lead and director of research and graduate studies for the UI College of Natural Resources. “The partnerships have to cover agencies and universities and industries. We can’t fix this alone. We have to do this together.” U.S. wildfires burned more than 10.1 million acres in 2015 — a new record, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced last month. Those fires destroyed 4,500 homes and structures and killed 13 firefighters. Wildfire suppression costs the United States, on average, $2.9 billion a year. The cascading consequences — such as health problems from poor air quality, post-fire landslides or loss of tourism — add up to staggering additional costs, Smith said.

2016-02-12,FRIDAY LETTER: The Vandal Flag in Boise,"February 12, 2016 	
 <https://gallery.mailchimp.com/e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef/images/78d0092c-6b67-41ab-8113-fb516677185b.jpg> 	
Dear Friends, 	
In “Beacon for Mountain and Plain,” historian Rafe Gibbs describes a mid-1870s effort to create a university in the Idaho Territory. In an address to the legislature, the governor noted that citizens, “inspired with a commendable zeal for the furtherance of the cause of education in our Territory, have inaugurated a movement for the establishment of a university at Boise City, to be called the University of Idaho.” History had other plans, though, and higher education had to wait until 1889, when the University of Idaho was established amid the rolling hills of the Palouse in beautiful Moscow.

Still, for more than a century the University of Idaho has maintained a robust presence in Boise and southwestern Idaho. An agricultural extension program was the first Vandal flag planted in the city in 1910. Exciting research, dynamic extension services and outstanding educational offerings have flourished in southwestern Idaho ever since.

UI-Boise offers educational opportunities <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=6d3508facd&e=55d7947efc>  for students at all stages. Our VandaLink transfer program <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=eeb747d1bd&e=55d7947efc> , recently bolstered with an additional $185,000 in need-based support, creates a smooth pathway between area community colleges and UI four-year options. Students can pursue a bachelor’s degree in areas such as dietetics, education and psychology, or advanced degrees in engineering, fire ecology and management, bioregional planning and community design, and many more. Our new Idaho Law and Justice Learning Center, in the former Ada County Courthouse, is home to second- and third-year law options, with a first-year program planned for 2017.

Research is another piece of our statewide mission. At the UI Water Center, the Center for Ecohydraulics Research anchors a thematic commitment to the study of water, natural resources and the environment in Idaho and the west. The Integrated Design Lab helps design high-performance, energy efficient buildings, an important goal for 21st-century sustainability. Our Confucius Institute is expanding to Boise to offer Chinese language and cultural instruction, a boon for students and business leaders alike. Our James A. and Louise McClure Center for Public Policy Research publishes policy briefs and other items <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=e2d0224cbd&e=55d7947efc> ; its recent “Life After High School” report has attracted notice to the challenges Idaho faces in achieving its postsecondary education goals. There are many other valuable programs and initiatives <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=d17eebe8e0&e=55d7947efc> , part of a commitment to exploring ideas that matter for Idaho.

The University’s research impact extends beyond Boise. In Caldwell, the Food Technology Center provides resources, space and expertise to facilitate entrepreneurial successes like Zacca Hummus <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=02115486fc&e=55d7947efc> . The Parma Research and Extension Center assists agricultural producers with research on everything from plant pathology to soil sciences. (The public can taste fruits of this labor at Parma’s annual Fruit Field Day in August.) You’ll also find research excellence in the Twin Falls and Kimberly Research and Extension Centers and at the world-renowned Hagerman Fish Culture Experiment Station.

UI also contributes to entrepreneurship and innovation with involvement in projects such as Trailhead, a community-based nonprofit that helps startup organizations and businesses; Tech Help, which offers manufacturing support and is Idaho’s affiliate of the National Institute of Standards and Technology Manufacturing Extension Partnership; and the Boise Valley Economic Partnership, which works to bring new businesses to the area. Our regional center director, Mike Satz, joins other UI-Boise leaders in getting involved with community and educational organizations, including the Treasure Valley Education partnership, the Educate Idaho Network, the Idaho Nonprofit Association and special projects such as Neighbors United.

The Vandal flag is waving high and proud <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=a34737e756&e=55d7947efc>  in Boise and beyond. Nearly 16,000 Vandals in the area can attest to that. In the coming years, we’re going to keep leveraging our strengths as Idaho’s leading, national research university, and continue to grow our presence in Idaho’s political capital and economic center.

Vandal Valentines Share Their Stories

With Valentine’s Day around the corner, the University of Idaho Alumni Facebook page will once again provide a space for couples to share their Vandal Love Story. Whitney ’08 and Kyle ’07 Westhoff were high school sweethearts who both enrolled at UI. During their time at the University of Idaho, their love for each other deepened. Married now for six years, they still call the Moscow campus their home away from home for their growing Vandal family. Fall in Moscow is something they both will always hold dear – the sound of Vandal football Saturday, the food, the colors, and the friendships. Though recent graduates, Whitney and Kyle have shown their support for Vandal student-athletes by making a gift to the Vandal Scholarship Fund each of the last six years.

UI Scientist Helps Weigh Saturn’s Brightest Ring

A recent study from NASA's Cassini mission proves that, in the mysterious and beautiful rings of Saturn, appearances can be deceiving. Researchers led by University of Idaho assistant professor of physics Matthew Hedman “weighed” the central parts of Saturn’s most massive ring for the first time, and the results suggest the ring is much less massive than some researchers had expected. In their analysis <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=5fee7da90d&e=55d7947efc> , Cassini scientists found surprisingly little correlation between how dense a ring might appear to be — in terms of its opacity and reflectiveness — and the amount of material it contains. The new results concern Saturn's B ring, the brightest and most opaque of Saturn's rings, and are consistent with previous studies that found similar results for Saturn's other main rings. Hedman and his colleagues came to their conclusion by examining fine-scale features of the rings using a new technique to analyze data gathered from Cassini as it peered through the rings toward Gamma Crucis, a bright, red giant star in the Southern Cross constellation.

Strong Job Market for Spring Graduates

University of Idaho graduates this May will walk across the stage into the best Idaho job market in 10 years. According to the Idaho Department of Labor <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=4a64da1ad4&e=55d7947efc> , “The stronger market will help [the state’s college graduates] find well-paying jobs more easily, but is also likely to affect the critical first 10 years of their careers, which is when the majority of lifetime earnings growth occurs.” A college degree continues to be critical for a stable financial future. “College graduates typically earn considerably more than other workers,” the department explains. “College graduates will likely earn higher pay fresh on the job than workers of all experience levels with no more than a high school diploma.” Among bachelor’s and master’s degree recipients, UI graduates earn higher beginning and mid-career salaries than graduates from any other institution in Idaho, competitive with other top schools region-wide, according to PayScale <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=9db60c6152&e=55d7947efc> . The Department of Labor notes that the highest demand continues to be for engineering and computer science majors, with rising demand for business majors, as well.

 <https://gallery.mailchimp.com/e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef/images/78d0092c-6b67-41ab-8113-fb516677185b.jpg> 	
Dear Friends, 	
In the early 1950s, the first lights powered by nuclear technology flickered to life in the desert of southeastern Idaho. The region has grown and thrived ever since, and the University of Idaho has played a key role in that development. In Idaho Falls and southeastern Idaho <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=09f6fceb46&e=55d7947efc> , UI carries out an ambitious and exciting research agenda, in partnership with organizations such as the Idaho National Laboratory and others. We also provide an array of educational opportunities, especially advanced education, and engage with communities through our Extension network.

The Center for Advanced Energy Studies (CAES) <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=fe241b43a6&e=55d7947efc>  is a unique facility in Idaho Falls, promoting research that seeks solutions for renewable energy and training the next generation of experts. In partnership with the Idaho National Laboratory, UI is a leader among four institutions that come together to offer timely and innovative research, education and policy resources that have impact and benefits for our state. For example, the competitive Frontier for Research in Geothermal Energy (FORGE) <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=acaec2ba25&e=55d7947efc>  grant examines the feasibility of establishing a geothermal laboratory in Idaho — a potentially very valuable resource for the entire region’s energy future. The Food, Water and Energy (FEW) nexus is also an important upcoming area of research, looking at the criticality of those resources in a changing world.

In most of these endeavors, the Idaho National Laboratory is a key player. The INL is a research and economic success story in the high plains of southeastern Idaho, and UI is proud to be an active partner in their efforts. Nuclear engineering is central to the work at UI-Idaho Falls. Rich Christensen joined UI in September as the director of nuclear engineering. With decades of experience at Ohio State University, Christensen and his team are fostering collaboration and responsiveness to industry needs, as they study everything from small nuclear reactors, to heat exchange, to the safety of nuclear systems and hybrid nuclear systems. We also serve the needs of the workforce in the region, including INL, offering their employees (and others) bachelor’s degrees in industrial technology and environmental science and master’s and doctoral-level education in multiple engineering and science-related disciplines.

Computer science is an area of excellence in southeastern Idaho. We have outstanding faculty in this area, including joint appointments with INL, who are seeing the needs of industry firsthand and are able to bring that perspective to students. New faculty member Michael Haney’s background in cybersecurity enables research collaboration with INL employees and gives students the best possible training they’ll need to take to employers, helping industry stay ahead of the game in this critical space.

We’re lucky to have the leadership of Executive Officer Marc Skinner at UI-Idaho Falls. Marc had previously worked at UI before serving as a faculty member and administrator at BYU-Idaho. He rejoined the Vandal family last summer, having forged great connections in the community and an understanding of the region’s educational offerings and needs. He’s involved with regional economic development, and recognizes how fast-growing and dynamic the region is — and how UI can serve that continued success. I’m excited about seeing the direction he’s able to take our research and education.

Lastly, I want to highlight our community engagement in southeastern Idaho. Through Extension, UI meets community needs in places like the Fort Hall Reservation, developing leaders there and across the region through programs such as 4-H. This is the often unseen work that is part of everyday life in town after town. We also recently hosted a community concert in Idaho Falls with the Lionel Hampton School of Music’s Jazz Band, Wind Ensemble and Idaho Brass Quintet. More than 500 people, including area high school students, attended the concert.

We’re proud to have an impact on the fabric of communities. UI employees don’t just have a passion for the land-grant mission of service to Idaho. We are community leaders, volunteers and dedicated citizens — wherever we are in this great state.

Idaho is our campus, we often say at UI. It is also our home. And we are proud to do all we can for the success of Idaho — our state, our home.

The Famous Kathleens Help Generations of Students

Kathleen Bailey Irwin ’37 and her daughter, Kay (Kathleen) Irwin Rowley ’63, ’87, are a generous mother and daughter team. Similar in so many ways, Irwin and Rowley both love playing the organ, earned degrees in education from UI and have chosen to financially support their alma mater. “The UI helped us grow and mature to make practical decisions on our journeys through life,” Rowley said. “We wish to help others on their journeys.” In fact, 101-year-old Irwin has been helping generations of Idaho students on their journeys through 42 years of loyal support, beginning with a $10 gift in 1970. In the decades since, Irwin has given regularly to the annual fund and the Department of Curriculum and Instruction. Together, Irwin and Rowley created an endowed scholarship in the College of Education in 2002, and in 2015, they donated vintage clothing to the Leila Old Historic Costume Collection. Most recently, Rowley has decided to honor her mother by naming a space after both Kathleens in the renovated College of Education building.

Idaho Agriculture Bolstered by Foltz Appointment

Idaho’s agriculture initiatives are receiving additional attention this spring as former College of Agricultural and Life Sciences (CALS) Term Dean John C. Foltz moves into a new position as assistant to the president for agricultural initiatives <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=fda72992c8&e=55d7947efc> . Newly appointed CALS Dean Michael Parella, former chair of the Department of Entomology and Nematology and associate dean of Agricultural Sciences at the University of California, Davis, started at UI on Feb. 1. In his new position, Foltz is working in collaboration with Parella and Jack McIver, vice president for Research and Economic Development, to lead statewide initiatives, including the Western Initiative for the Dairy Environment (WIDE), a large-scale research center focused on Idaho’s beef and dairy industry. The university has explored such a center in the Magic Valley of south-central Idaho for more than a decade. “Being able to maintain the momentum for Idaho agriculture is vitally important to the industry, our citizens and our students,” Foltz said.

Dear Friends, 	
This week marks the 49th anniversary of the University of Idaho’s acclaimed Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=f23bd308fb&e=55d7947efc> , an example of Vandal excellence in arts and culture and educational outreach. This signature UI event highlights some of the strengths of our university: our ability to bring culture and community together, our commitment to outreach and engagement with young people, and our opportunities for students to learn and excel through an experience they’d find no place else. It’s an exciting time filled with nearly 100 student-artist workshops, some 400 student performances and entertainment from leading lights of the music world.

The workshop and seminars over the course of the week give K-12 and UI students a chance to study with accomplished professionals, receiving mentorship and hands-on instruction. Secondary students visiting us this week also experience the college environment and have the opportunity to picture themselves succeeding at the University of Idaho. Not all of them will be music majors, of course, but we hope this experience opens up their idea of how accessible a college education is and how they can and should succeed in it.

This year the Jazz Fest experience has also come directly to high schools across the region through our Jazz in Schools <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=21dce5a8bf&e=55d7947efc>  program. More than 8,000 students in dozens of schools participate in the program. It’s an outreach program that only a university of our reach and mission can and or would attempt, and of which we can all be justly proud. Those students in our small towns and larger cities are gaining a window into a uniquely American art form. Jazz is about improvisation and collaboration — as music, it perfectly embodies the “Pathways to Discovery” theme. Those lessons go well beyond music, of course, and can be applied to a wide range of endeavors both academic and personal.

This year we’re excited to welcome a diverse array of professional performers <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=0b9c9492a8&e=55d7947efc>  to the Palouse, including many Grammy winners. It’s a broad range of music, from jazz funk to big band, to swing, to blues and more. Already this week we’ve seen our talented performers from UI join nationally recognized musicians for two nights of concerts. This weekend will bring another two nights of exciting music from well-known performers — I hope you’ll join Mary Beth and me in attending these events. We enjoy the buzz of activity in the Moscow community around this special week.

The Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival is a remarkable, multifaceted event. I want to thank the faculty and staff members, students, and volunteers who make it possible year after year. We have a passionate and committed advisory board and other alumni who care about this festival and appreciate both the music and the opportunity to showcase our university.

The past half-century of music festivals offers us a heritage and history that we can draw from to invigorate the festival in coming years. The Jazz Fest has enriched our community and opened up new pathways for students for many years now — I look forward to the festival to come this weekend, and to the bright future we’ll discover together.

Avista Kick-Starts Endowment for Grand Challenges Engineering Scholars

The University of Idaho College of Engineering and Avista Corporation have launched a unique endowment to support UI Grand Challenges Scholars Program students — a new generation of engineers expressly equipped to tackle some of the most pressing issues facing society in the 21st century. Avista established a $25,000 endowment to recognize and honor alumnus Don F. Kopczynski <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=6cc4ac2b06&e=55d7947efc> , a member of the UI Academy of Engineers and retired vice president of Avista Corporation. The endowment will support scholarships and activities related to the program. “Funding and volunteer mentoring from the private sector will play a critical role in the success of the Grand Challenges Scholars Program,” said Jim Ritter, president of the UI Academy of Engineers, who is leading the campaign to build industry and alumni support for the initiative.

Research Explores Nanotechnology-Based Explosives Sensor

University of Idaho physics professor David McIlroy will dig into the details of nanotechnology-based explosives detection with a three-year, $408,000 grant from the Department of Defense’s Office of Naval Research. The explosives sensor McIlroy has developed incorporates nanosprings — telephone-cord shaped coils of silica 500 times thinner than a human hair — which McIlroy invented. McIlroy’s new project will focus on defining and understanding the underlying factors that make the sensor work, which opens the door to designing a more robust and reliable sensor. He will work with two graduate students and two undergraduate summer researchers. McIlroy’s sensor design uses xenon light bulbs — which cost just a few dollars and are commonly used in items such as overhead projectors — coated with nanosprings and a material that reacts with certain chemicals used to make explosives. The bulb provides heat to activate the reactive material, while the nanosprings provide a huge amount of surface area in a small space, allowing the sensor to react to extremely low concentrations of chemicals.

2016-03-04,The Friday Letter: Our Options for UI Football,"March 4, 2016

Dear Friends, 	
This week you heard news about the discontinuation of our football team’s affiliation with the Sun Belt Conference <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=70f60f74d4&e=55d7947efc>  after the 2017 season. While the timing of the Sun Belt’s decision was unexpected, we face the future with options, and with confidence that we will choose the right course for our university.
 
Athletics is an important part of the University of Idaho. It serves as the “front porch” of our university and a place to build community. Athletics also provides opportunities for our student-athletes to excel in competition and in the classroom.
 
I doubt that many institutions can match the loyalty and enthusiasm of our Vandal family. Football brings us together, something I enjoy every football Saturday in the fall. We created the Fan Zone — an iteration of which you’ll see again next fall — and set a course to build an arena for our court sports, because we know that a university’s excellence is measured in part by the quality of its Athletics programs, and we must invest in Athletics if we want to see positive results.
 
I understand how important the conference affiliation decision is for our university. Over the course of the past year, in settings public and private, I communicated the value UI brings to the Sun Belt conference, and that our football program is on the upswing. Stability is very important in terms of finding a good conference fit for our university. And uncertain conference affiliation has challenged our ability to build the best possible program.
 
I know that our alumni, students and fans have passionate opinions about the right place for Vandal football and that there is a good deal of disagreement about where we should be going forward. There is strong support for each of our two current options after 2017: 1) play as an independent member of the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) until we can stably affiliate with an appropriate FBS conference, or 2) accept an invitation to join the Big Sky Conference. No other option exists nor can we depend on other opportunities arising. The Big Sky has asked UI to join them, setting a May 4 deadline on their invitation. A decision whether to accept that invitation, subject to State Board approval, is forthcoming, and we will be open and straightforward in how and when we communicate our decision.
 
The decision I make on behalf of the Vandal Family will be informed by what is best for our student-athletes, for our students and fans, and for our university. That means positioning our student-athletes to excel, securing the stability and autonomy we need to build a successful program for the long-term, and ensuring the very best student and fan experience possible.
 
I went to 10 of 12 football games last season, so I’ve had a firsthand look at how hard our student-athletes compete and the progress that they are making. I’ve seen the positive fan experience that a good crowd and a victory brings to the Kibbie Dome (a top-10 college football venue <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=0ac1a5dd2d&e=55d7947efc> , according to USA Today), and I’ve appreciated the vibrancy on campus and genuine uplift in university-wide morale that results.
 
I will study our options and make the best decision for our university. We will build a future of football excellence at UI. We will build an arena to be an outstanding home for our court sports. I will count on our Vandal family to support that progress. No matter where our “front porch” is located, we will gather on it as Vandals — brave and bold.

A Tax-free Opportunity to Support UI

The IRA charitable rollover means that University of Idaho supporters can make a gift of up to $100,000 directly from an IRA to benefit UI – and it’s tax-free. An IRA charitable rollover may make good sense if you are 70 1/2 or older, if you want to satisfy your IRA’s minimum required distribution without generating taxable income, or if you want to apply your gift against a pledge. The gift must be transferred directly from the IRA administrator to the University of Idaho Foundation Inc. (Follow this link for more information and sample letters <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=0ee1819c51&e=55d7947efc> .) To learn more about making an IRA charitable rollover gift, please contact your IRA administrator, your tax advisor or Sharon L.

New Master of Laws Degree for Fall 2016

The University of Idaho College of Law anticipates launching a new Master of Laws (LL.M.) degree program <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=afab5ec65b&e=55d7947efc> , beginning for fall semester, 2016. The program was approved by the State Board of Education on Feb. 18, one month after approval by the American Bar Association. The final step in approval is review by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities. A Master of Laws is an internationally recognized postgraduate law degree that can be completed in nine months. Law students often pursue the LL.M. to gain expertise in a specialized field of law. At UI, LL.M. students will be able to choose an emphasis in democracy, justice and the American legal system; natural resources and environmental law; business law and entrepreneurship; or litigation and alternative dispute resolution. “The addition of the LL.M. degree marks a significant academic expansion at the College of Law,” said Dean Mark L. Adams. 

UI Alumna Named Woman of the Year

University of Idaho alumna Nora Carpenter has been named Woman of the Year for 2016 <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=a448d5e92d&e=55d7947efc>  by the Idaho Business Review. The president and CEO of United Way Treasure Valley was honored February 25 at a gala event at the Boise Centre. Carpenter was selected from among 50 distinguished nominees. The Women of the Year nominee class included four University of Idaho employees: Cori Mantle-Bromley, dean of the UI College of Education; Terri Muse, assistant dean for external relations at the UI College of Law in Boise; SeAnne Safaii-Waite, associate professor of family and consumer science for the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences at UI Boise and UI Coeur d’Alene; and Barbara Zanzig Lock, director of the Low Income Taxpayer Clinic and lecturer of tax law at the UI College of Law in Boise. The class included eight Vandal alumni.

Dear Friends, 	
The University of Idaho serves the students of Idaho; that is a central part of who we are. But our impact does not stop at the state line. We are also a premier destination for students from across the United States. Those students find UI an excellent choice for a transformative experience <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=12666363e3&e=55d7947efc>  and a great value <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=42b43a8c1f&e=55d7947efc>  from a national research university.
 
Last fall, 30 percent of UI students joined us from across the nation, representing all 50 states. The Vandal impact has national reach. Why? Simply put, we offer out-of-state students something they cannot find in other places. That means outstanding degree programs, unique experiences and a connected Vandal family that is like no other. Students from outside Idaho give back to the university, too, contributing perspectives and life experiences that create a vibrant living and learning community.
 
Our student body president, Max Cowan <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=9b15211360&e=55d7947efc> , originally hails from Portland, Oregon. He is in his second term as president of the Associated Students of the University of Idaho (ASUI). I’ve enjoyed working with Max president-to-president. I’ve seen him lead the executive branch of our student government with openness and integrity, valuing the input of others, designing smart policies and making tough decisions. Max is an environmental science and chemistry major. When he graduates this spring, he’ll have a bright future ahead of him, and he’ll leave behind a lasting legacy.
 
We have many students from even farther afield, including Sarah Rose, a National Merit Scholar from the Chicago, Illinois, area. I met Sarah nearly two years ago during a visit Mary Beth and I made to the Taylor Wilderness Research Station. A double major in ecology and conservation biology and rangeland ecology and management, for her senior project Sarah designed and built a garden at Taylor that supplies fresh produce to visiting students and professors. As profiled in the latest issue of our College of Natural Resources magazine, Sarah found Taylor and our Semester in the Wild <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=acb8c9a8f0&e=55d7947efc>  program a chance to dive deep into a unique interdisciplinary educational experience, learning more about herself in the process. We’re grateful for the contributions she’s made that will live long after she graduates and heads into an exciting future.
 
Service, recreation, special programs — those are points of excellence that attract outstanding students like Max, Sarah and many others, and they are invaluable. But as a parent of students who have attended out-of-state institutions, I’m also sensitive to the price tag that accompanies that proposition. So I must point out that we are an option that many out-of-state students find affordable. Our net cost for non-Idaho students often compares very favorably to other states’ in-state net cost. That affordability helps our students graduate with less debt, positioning them for a stronger financial future <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=b8f44413e3&e=55d7947efc> .
 
We’re proud that so many students from across the U.S. join Idaho students in finding a place to flourish at UI. They’re discovering something we hope is no secret — that the University of Idaho is a unique institution. It is a place to explore new possibilities and to find the mentorship and hands-on experience that helps one forge a bright future. Just as it is a great place to be from, it is a great place to go … on your way to the rest of the world.

Alumni Support Helps Transform the UI Library

Julie Levine ’75 and her husband, David ’74, are helping enhance the student experience at the state’s largest library. “We are proud to support the University of Idaho Library because it is a center for scholarship and research,” Julie explained. “It benefits students, faculty, staff and visiting scholars.” Julie, a member of the library advisory board, and David, are donors to the library’s first floor remodel project <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=768ff2bedf&e=55d7947efc> . The $1.3 million project, scheduled for completion in the spring of 2016, will be a technology-rich center that facilitates collaborative learning. “The Levines’ gifts recognize the vital role the library plays in attracting and retaining students,” said Dean of Libraries Lynn Baird. “Offering students quality learning environments with access to top-rate technology provides them with a competitive edge in the workplace. We are very grateful to the Levines for their generosity.” For information on giving to the University Library, contact Jim Zuba at 208-885-4142 or jzuba@uidaho.edu <mailto:jzuba@uidaho.edu> .  

CLASS Launches Six New Online Degrees

The University of Idaho’s College of Letters, Arts and Social Sciences (CLASS) will begin offering six new online degree programs <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=cf1f9129de&e=55d7947efc>  in fall 2016. The programs — a Master of Public Administration <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=238a09faec&e=55d7947efc>  and bachelor’s degrees in sociology, with an emphasis on criminology <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=4ae0215952&e=55d7947efc> , history, psychology, organizational sciences and general studies — were approved in February by the Idaho State Board of Education. The programs are already part of the college’s Moscow-based curriculum and will be taught by the existing professors. “Launching these programs is tremendously exciting,” CLASS Dean Andrew Kersten said. “We are embarking on a new way to serve the citizens of Idaho. The hallmark of the University of Idaho is quality and value. We are bringing those into the online realm.” All new online programs will launch later this year. 

UI Appoints Marc Chopin Dean of College of Business

Marc Chopin has been appointed the University of Idaho’s next dean of the College of Business and Economics <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=1fb7dc58b4&e=55d7947efc> , effective July 1, 2016. Chopin is currently a professor of economics at Northern Arizona University. He has served in university administration for approximately 13 years, including five years at Northern Arizona University where he was dean and associate dean of the W.A. Franke College of Business and interim director of the School of Hotel and Restaurant Management, helping to transition that school to the College of Business. Chopin also engages with the business and not-for-profit communities through several board memberships and by working with and mentoring entrepreneurs and start-up companies in Flagstaff and Phoenix. “We feel fortunate to have Marc Chopin join UI as our new dean of Business and Economics,” said John Wiencek, UI’s provost and executive vice president. “He is a proven scholar, educator and dean coming from a peer research institution. His ability to effectively collaborate and communicate bodes well for the college's future.""

2016-03-18,The Friday Letter: Our Vandals Go Dancing at the NCAA Tournament,"March 18, 2016

Dear Friends, 	
What would March be without a little “madness”? The NCAA basketball tournaments are an action-packed time for colleges, student-athletes and fans across the country.
 
Having delivered a Big Sky Conference championship <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=d642ca62b2&e=55d7947efc>  to the University of Idaho, today our Vandal women take the floor on college basketball’s biggest stage. They have drawn a tough opponent in Baylor, but I know Coach Jon Newlee will have them ""ready to play,"" as he says. Our Vandals play exciting, team-oriented basketball, and they will give a determined effort in Waco, Texas. The game will be televised, and Vandals can come together across the Northwest to watch and root on <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=5c188cdc04&e=55d7947efc>  our student-athletes. This is their third trip to the NCAA tournament in the last four years — an impressive run of on-the-court excellence.
 
The men’s team had a 21-win season and went to the CBI tournament. Though they had a tough loss Wednesday night, they played with heart and determination all season. We are all proud of how they represented our university and our state.
 
This weekend we are getting an up-close-and-personal look at NCAA Tournament action in Spokane. Thanks to Rob Spear’s vision, the University of Idaho is the host for this weekend’s festivities at the Spokane Veterans Memorial Arena. That means that you’ll see UI people in Spokane, ready to talk about the tournament and the University of Idaho. You’ll see the UI name splashed across the court, and you’ll see Vandal banners proudly waving in Spokane.
 
Spokane, Eastern Washington and North Idaho are a vital part of our university’s footprint. More than 12,000 Vandal alumni call the area home. Many students from Spokane and nearby are currently pursuing a great future through a transformative educational experience at UI. They are discovering a top-tier academic environment; a community with abundant opportunities for service, recreation and leadership; and a nationally ranked value for affordability and return on investment <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=395105ce25&e=55d7947efc> . We are a higher education leader in the Northwest <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=e2972b3caf&e=55d7947efc> , and the UI reputation is strong and getting stronger.
 
Athletics are an important window into our university. We appreciate the opportunity to let the rest of the country learn more about our special institution. Join me and the rest of the Vandal family in enjoying the ride, and rooting for our Vandal women and for a special weekend of basketball in Spokane.

Estate Plan Endows English Scholarship

After earning an English degree from the College of Letters, Arts and Social Sciences <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=db7b616492&e=55d7947efc> , Alyce Joyce Archuleta ’64 spent most of her life working as a librarian. It was in doing this work that she met her husband and fellow world traveler, Michael. Together, the Archuletas have built a life of learning, discovery and adventure in San Diego, California. Moscow and University of Idaho campus are never far from Alyce’s heart, though. The Archuletas recently included UI in their estate plan. Their generosity will endow a new scholarship named for the pair in the English department. ""We are incredibly grateful for the generosity that the Archuletas have shown to the English department and CLASS,” said Dean Andrew Kersten. “This gift will help to transform the lives of many students for years to come."" For more information on giving to CLASS, contact Pete Mundt, director of development, at 208-885-5013 or peterm@uidaho.edu <mailto:peterm@uidaho.edu> . 

Game Today: Vandals Draw Baylor in NCAA Tournament 

The University of Idaho will enter the 2016 NCAA Tournament <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=a5be164e8a&e=55d7947efc>  as a No. 16 seed in the Dallas Region. The Vandals (24-9) will play the first-seeded Baylor Bears at 2 p.m. today, March 18, in Waco, Texas. It can be seen on ESPN2. “It will be a big challenge,” head coach Jon Newlee said following the announcement. “We will not back down from it. We will be ready to play on Friday.” Idaho earned its third trip to the NCAA tournament in the past four seasons, defeating Idaho State, 67-55, in the Big Sky Tournament championship. Freshman Mikayla Ferenz scored 18 points in the game and 67 in the tournament on her way to being voted Tournament MVP. The Vandals return to the NCAA tournament in 2016 after missing out on post-season play a year ago. Previously, Idaho made back-to-back trips to the NCAA tournament in 2013 and 2014. This will be the fourth NCAA tournament trip for the Vandal women. 

UI Students Give Back During Alternative Service Break

University of Idaho students will spend spring break March 14-18 working alongside humanitarian organizations in Idaho, Washington and Oregon as part of the university’s Alternative Service Break (ASB) program <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=dc0cbae626&e=55d7947efc> . Run by UI’s Department of Student Involvement and Center for Volunteerism and Social Action, ASB promotes student learning and development through hands-on service opportunities. The group consists of 11 teams, with 59 total students and seven faculty and staff advisors. Teams will spend the week serving an established community partner in working toward its mission. Among other projects, they will learn about homelessness initiatives at the Boise Rescue Mission Ministries and Corpus Christi House; practice sustainable agriculture as a holistic solution to veterans issues at Growing Veterans in Mount Vernon, Washington; and work with a native plant nursery and on sustainable trail management in the Tillamook State Forest in Oregon.

2016-03-25,The Friday Letter: The Best Way to Stay Engaged,"March 25, 2016 	
 <https://gallery.mailchimp.com/e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef/images/78d0092c-6b67-41ab-8113-fb516677185b.jpg> 	
Dear Friends,

Reading is one of the great pleasures in life. Access to libraries and the collection of scholars in one place with students were the foundation of universities in the Middle Ages, the early origins of our modern higher education system. Reading remains central to what we expect of students at the University of Idaho. It’s also central to the work of a president.
 
All freshmen and transfer students embark on a “Common Read,” <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=26fd1c08f4&e=55d7947efc>  a book selection that promotes a community-wide intellectual experience around a topic of relevance. Last year I joined our students in reading “All the Light We Cannot See,” a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel set in World War II. It was a great thrill to join our university community in hosting the author, Boise’s own Anthony Doerr <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=5627196122&e=55d7947efc> , to give a presentation about the book.
 
Reading is an invaluable way to get information. I was told several years ago, “If you don’t have time to read, you don’t have time to lead.” If you’re not staying informed by reading widely, you might not be making the best possible decisions. So, aside from the inescapable world of email, what do I, as president, read?
 
Each day, of course, I scan the local news: the Moscow-Pullman Daily News, The Lewiston Tribune, the Idaho Statesman, The Spokesman-Review and more. The Argonaut, our student media outlet, is part of my steady diet, and I check the Idaho Business Review for a state business perspective. Our family shares a subscription to The New York Times, but most often, my expert “clipping service” of Mary Beth and our children send me articles. Facebook friends <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=8f9f61a7c3&e=55d7947efc>  also direct my attention to articles of interest, albeit at the cost of too much Facebook time.
 
I am a higher education junkie, so the Chronicle of Higher Education, University Business Magazine and Inside Higher Education electronic briefings are daily rituals and great entrées to timely reports on higher education policy and innovation. Higher education books are on the list: “Designing the New American University,” by Arizona State University President Michael Crow; “The Innovative University,” by Clayton Christensen and Henry Eyring; and “Locus of Authority” by William Bowin and Eugene Tobin. Crow’s book, in particular, has influenced my thinking on the critical roles of public research universities in social mobility as well as in interdisciplinary research.
 
I don’t set as much time aside as I should for recreational reading, and my Kindle Reader reflects some eclectic interests, running from detective fiction to history – everything from John Grisham and Janet Evanovich to books like “The Wright Brothers” by David McCullough. My occasional mention of the book “Warrior to Dreadnought” by David Brown has elicited some snarky comments about my tastes, but in my defense, 1865-1905 was a time of immense change in naval architecture, and the book highlights interesting engineering and change management issues. That’s reading, though – you nurture existing interests, cultivate new ones and share what you learn. 
 
Writing this letter may give you some insight into my interests as president. It certainly increases my resolve to expand my reading. We’ll be announcing our 2016-2017 Common Read soon, and while I can’t give it away, I assure you that it looks like a very compelling book that will give us a lot to think about. I look forward to coming together as a community to read it, share our understandings, and engage with ideas that matter through reading. 

Have you read any good books lately? Share them with me on Facebook. <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=a4c2a325dd&e=55d7947efc>

Enhancing Faculty Retention and Undergraduate Research

Carl ’68 and Kirby ’68 Dyess recently donated $262,000 to enhance the Dyess College of Science Endowment, providing additional funding for faculty fellowships, undergraduate research and strategic initiatives. ""The additional gift will enhance the ability of the College of Science to further our two primary goals — to attract and retain excellent faculty and provide an opportunity for undergraduates to participate in research that has real-world applications,” said the Dyesses. “We believe that if students can see the relevance of their classroom and lab studies to life situations early in their academic careers, they will be better students and get a head start on planning their post-graduate activities, whether that is further education, working in industry, or both."" Carl, an attorney and entrepreneur, and Kirby, the principal in Austin Capital Management, also donate their time on UI and corporate boards. For information on giving to the College of Science, contact Eric Bennett at ebennett@uidaho.edu <mailto:ebennett@uidaho.edu>  or 208-885-9106. 

College of Law Leaps 16 Spots in Rankings

The University of Idaho College of Law climbed 16 spots <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=1ad314bcd6&e=55d7947efc>  on the U.S. News & World Report rankings of best law schools in the nation, up to position 111. This significant rise is one of the highest in the country and puts the college ahead of other law schools in Eastern Washington, Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota and South Dakota. The University of Idaho College of Law is the only ranked law school in the state. “While rankings can be one of many ways to evaluate the quality of a law school, this leap signifies how our reputation continues to grow in a positive direction,” said Mark L. Adams, dean of the College of Law. “Our faculty are experts in their fields yet they make themselves accessible to students. We provide an affordable and stellar education. And our career development center works diligently to help our students find jobs post-graduation.”  

Idaho WWAMI Partner Best Nationwide for Primary Care

Through the Idaho WWAMI program, the University of Idaho partners with the University of Washington’s School of Medicine to educate aspiring physicians from Idaho. The UW School of Medicine was ranked No. 1 in the nation <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=27caf65de4&e=55d7947efc>  for primary care education by in U.S. News & World Report’s 2017 Best Medical School rankings. The school was also ranked No. 1 for family medicine and No. 1 for rural medicine. The state of Idaho recently ranked 49th among states in per capita physicians; a shortage that is particularly felt in rural areas. Through the Idaho WWAMI program, Idaho students access UW resources and expertise, spending some time in Seattle but completing most of their curriculum in Idaho. A rural and underserved track positions students to serve in rural communities upon completion of their training. The program includes established residency opportunities — an in-demand component of medical education, especially in Idaho. The WWAMI program was established in 1972, and is expanding this year to include 40 seats for Idaho students.

2016-04-01,The Friday Letter: Why the Place Where You Attend College Matters,"April 1, 2016 	
 <https://gallery.mailchimp.com/e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef/images/78d0092c-6b67-41ab-8113-fb516677185b.jpg> 	
Dear Friends, 	
The place where you attend college matters. Sounds obvious, right? Just find the right school. But I want to concentrate on more expansive definitions of place and “matters.” Where you attend school is not just about the name of the institution on your sweatshirt, but about the community you discover, the setting for your growth as a person in these important years.
 
Where you attend college is where you’ll grow as a person, work toward your professional future and forge lifelong friendships. Students won’t find any place quite like Moscow. This town is not just the backdrop to a university experience, it’s a special setting in which to learn and live. It’s a vibrant community, filled with opportunities for entertainment, recreation and culture; it’s also an unrivaled gateway to outdoor adventure <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=5adcbb76bc&e=55d7947efc> . No surprise that Moscow has been named one of America’s top college towns. <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=dd59c8c0f4&e=55d7947efc> 
 
This weekend admitted students have a chance to experience that for themselves during our UIdaho Bound weekend <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=b6a29e73ec&e=55d7947efc> . <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=cb0fbd2ede&e=55d7947efc>  Tonight is “Moscow Friday,” a downtown celebration with music and food. Mary Beth and I will join our city and community leaders in welcoming students to the lively downtown. With new restaurants and businesses, and more on the way, it’s an exciting time for our town. I can’t wait to show that off to our prospective students, and hope as many Moscow people as possible come out and join the fun.
 
On Saturday, UIdaho Bound participants get an extended opportunity to picture themselves as Vandals. They’ll take tours of our historic campus, where new facilities are coming to life. They’ll learn more about the hundreds of student activities and organizations on campus, see our residence halls and fraternity and sorority living options. Sessions on the logistics of college are critical, too, in everything from money management to registering for classes. We have late-night activities planned at our nationally recognized Student Recreation Center, as well.
 
We’ve changed how we approach this weekend. Previously, we asked students to come up for “Moscow Thursday” and take their campus tours on a Friday. That schedule represents a significant difficulty for parents and guardians to take off work. We wanted to improve access and minimize time off, so we moved the events to Friday and Saturday. Many students and families are taking advantage of the change to join us this weekend, and we have another great UIdaho Bound weekend on April 22-23, for which admitted students can still register <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=74a90c6364&e=55d7947efc> .
 
I’m grateful to our faculty and staff, who are working to make Saturday a special day for prospective students. The close connections our students make with supportive staff and with faculty on the leading edge of their disciplines separates UI from other institutions. At UI, students aren’t just faces in the crowd — they’re engaged in hands-on learning opportunities with outstanding educators who are invested in student success.
 
Weekends like this help students still deciding on a school really understand what we mean when we say that UI — and our town of Moscow — are big enough to matter, and small enough to care.

College of Law Advisory Council Honors Don Burnett

The College of Law Advisory Council recently created an endowed scholarship to honor Don Burnett, former dean of the College of Law, for his service to the college and the council. This perpetual fund will provide scholarships to students with high financial need, giving them access to an education, while at the same time helping the college in its student recruitment efforts. “Don’s service to the university and to the College of Law, in particular, is well known,” said Mark L. Adams, dean of the College of Law. “This scholarship fund is a wonderful way to honor that legacy.” Burnett will retire from the University of Idaho at the end of this spring semester after working for 14 years at UI. For more information about giving to the College of Law or the Burnett Scholarship fund, contact Terri Muse, assistant dean for external relations at 208-364-4044 or tmuse@uidaho.edu <mailto:tmuse@uidaho.edu> . 

Grant Creates STEM Program for Nez Perce Students 

University of Idaho researchers are teaming up with the Nez Perce Tribe to inspire the tribe’s next generation of scientists <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=175889f307&e=55d7947efc> . UI received a $1.1 million grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to start a program designed to help Nez Perce high school students form an identity as scientists while learning to use cutting-edge remote sensing technologies such as unmanned aerial vehicles. Thirty students at Lapwai High School will attend a camp in summer 2017 at UI’s McCall Outdoor Science School, or MOSS. In the year following, a Lapwai teacher will lead a class where students further develop their science skills, study local problems that could be addressed with remote-sensing technology and work in collaboration with the tribe’s natural resources departments. Meanwhile, the research team will work collaboratively  with the community to develop research and evaluation questions to understand how using advanced technologies and addressing meaningful problems help the students not only learn principals of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), but also form a “STEM identity” connected to their cultural identity. 

Clean Snowmobile Team Wins Awards at National Competition

For the second year in a row the University of Idaho engineering Clean Snowmobile Challenge (CSC) <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=daf0f442fb&e=55d7947efc>  team returned from its annual competition at Michigan Tech University’s Keweenaw Research Center winner of the coveted Founder’s Trophy.The award recipient is selected by their peers for the most sportsmanlike conduct. In an event where teams have to be prepared for anything to go wrong, the UI team has built helping other teams into their engineering culture, even when their own sled is not performing optimally. The Vandal team also brought home awards for Most Likely to be Manufactured, Enovation E-Controls and the Most Innovative Emissions Design. In addition, UI’s “Voodoo” sled completed the 100-mile endurance run with the best overall gas mileage of 19.3 mpg, winning the team the Best Fuel Economy Award. More than 20 teams from the U.S., Canada and Finland competed in this year’s weeklong event. The intent of the competition is to develop snowmobiles that are more suitable for use in environmentally sensitive areas such as national parks.

2016-04-08,The Friday Letter: International Experiences at UI,"April 8, 2016

Dear Friends, 	
You’ve heard me mention the “Friendship Families” program at the University of Idaho, something Mary Beth and I have gotten involved with over the past two years. We’ve come to know students from overseas who have chosen UI as the right place to pursue a transformative education. The Friendship Families program has helped us get to know talented individual students, but also learn more about the international experience at UI.
 
One such student is Pavan Penkey, a master’s student in electrical engineering. Pavan is the president of the Indian Students' Association <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=92e46fb3a8&e=55d7947efc> , a group of students and faculty members interested in celebrating and sharing Indian culture. This month I hope the UI community joins me in attending their annual India Night celebration. With great food, music and attire, this is quite an experience, one that can be fun and enriching for all students and faculty and staff.
 
India Night showcases a particular culture, but it is also a great example of the vibrancy that international students from 80 countries around the world bring to our campus and our community. They are drawn to UI by our reputation for excellence. Growing up and studying as an undergraduate in India, Pavan knew little about Idaho and less about UI, but a mentor knew of the excellence of Professor Brian Johnson in our College of Engineering, and recommended our institution. That’s the kind of word-of-mouth that we can be very proud of — the kind that travels over oceans and continents. We want to tell the world: This is a place where you can succeed, and where you can find a globally competitive academic experience.
 
The reputation is well-earned. One of our distinguished guests at India Night this year is Dayaldas Meshri, a doctoral recipient in chemical engineering who went on to found a successful chemical research company. (I’ll just say that if you use a cellphone, you use this company’s products.) We’re fortunate to have alumni like Dr. Meshri stay involved at UI, and come back to share their experience and perspectives. They are proof of how a Vandal education makes our country and our world a better place.
 
Our global connections offer a number of different programmatic opportunities. The Indian Student Association is one of many international student organizations that contribute to a rich campus culture. Our Confucius Institute <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=709edd3d7c&e=55d7947efc>  is expanding cultural and language instruction across Idaho. Our Martin Institute <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=823d13d90d&e=55d7947efc>  offers programs on international themes and events like this week’s Borah Symposium, <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=b1be79974e&e=55d7947efc>  as well as degree paths for students in interested in international work. (All three of the latter examples are housed in our College of Letters, Arts and Social Sciences.) UI students can travel and explore interests through Study Abroad programs organized by our International Programs Office <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=9c94c8f7e9&e=55d7947efc> .
 
There are many doors that UI hold open to the world. These are programs of depth and caliber only found at Idaho’s leading, national research university. As we continue to find new areas of growth and build upon current success, our reputation will continue to grow here and abroad.

A Lifetime of Giving 

Ken ’68 and Jane Reagan have been avid supporters of Vandal Athletics for more than 40 years. In fact, there has been only one year since 1968 where the Reagans have not attended a football game. Ken’s passion for his alma mater stem from his experience as a member of Phi Gamma Delta fraternity and the lifelong friends he created there. These 30-year football season ticket holders have actively advocated for and financially supported UI since 1977, including donating to nearly every athletic expansion project. Currently, Ken is a member of the Vandal Scholarship Fund and the Quarterbacks Club. “We would like to graciously thank Ken and Jane Reagan for their continued support of the University of Idaho and Vandal Athletics,” said Suzy Stride, associate director of development for the Vandal Scholarship Fund. The Reagans have three children, including two daughters and sons-in-law who graduated from UI. For information on supporting the Vandal Scholarship Fund, contact Suzy Stride at 208-334-2087 or suzystride@uidaho.edu <mailto:suzystride@uidaho.edu> . 

UI Junior Receives Prestigious Goldwater Scholarship

A University of Idaho engineering and science student has been selected to receive a prestigious Goldwater Scholarship <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=f0fcf4d78b&e=55d7947efc>  through the Barry Goldwater Scholarship and Excellence in Education Program. UI’s award recipient is Alyssa Ertel, a third-year Honors program student from Kennewick, Washington, majoring in chemical engineering in the College of Engineering and chemistry in the College of Science. Ertel is also president of UI’s Society of Women Engineers Chapter, and a member of the DeVlieg Innovation design team, which will present at the Engineering Design EXPO at the end of April. “Becoming a Goldwater Scholar became a dream of mine when I realized that I could make a difference through research,” Ertel said. “It’s truly an honor, and I feel incredibly lucky to be surrounded by faculty members and peers that encouraged and inspired me to achieve my goals.” For the 2016-17 academic year, the scholarships are being awarded to 252 students, selected on the basis of academic merit from a field of more than 1,150 nominees nationwide. The one- and two-year scholarships cover the cost of tuition, fees, books and room and board, up to $7,500 per year. 

UI Wins at Idaho Entrepreneur Challenge

University of Idaho students showed off their business plans during the annual Idaho Entrepreneur Challenge competition in Boise last week. About 20 students from the College of Business and Economics' Idaho Entrepreneurs program participated in the competition, which showcases ideas and pitches from 75 new venture teams from colleges and universities across Idaho. UI had seven teams in the final round and the students collectively won $40,000, more than any other school <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=815878524c&e=55d7947efc> . “All of our entrepreneurs performed at a high level,” said George Tanner, director of Idaho Entrepreneurs. “Their pitches were good, their plans were well-developed and the Vandal spirit once again energized this competition. We dominated the categories we entered and I am very proud of their performance.” Among other awards, a UI student team won first place in the Healthy Living category with a wearable technology prototype that offers an “electrocution solution” for utility workers and electricians; first runner-up and the “Best Pitch” prize in the Agriculture Technology category with an innovative pump solution for wildland firefighters; and second place in Technology for a safety wakeboard/ski handle.

Dear Friends, 	
“Make no little plans, they have no magic to stir men's blood."" – Daniel Burnham
 
Several years ago, a friend of mine described the importance of sharing a vision when pursuing an important objective. His analogy was the stone breaker working in a quarry. If one views that job as breaking rocks, it's difficult to imagine being inspired or innovative about the day’s work. It’s hard to see how one would get up in the morning with enthusiasm to go break rocks. But if those rocks are headed for the Parthenon, you are no longer a stone breaker, but a temple builder, anxious to see how the next stone fits into a beautiful structure. This is the attitude that I believe each of us who loves the university must have, whether student, faculty or staff member, alumni or friend. And this is the attitude that can sustain us through difficulty and frustration.
 
Yesterday we shared our Strategic Plan for 2016-2025 <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=9b87506d34&e=55d7947efc>  with the State Board of Education. This plan, thanks in large part to the energy and innovation of Provost and Executive Vice President John Wiencek, has been developed with unprecedented collaboration and input. The plan puts forth a shared vision of what the University of Idaho can become if we all work together, as well as metrics for us to measure success.
 
This plan was not intended as a blueprint, but a conceptual sketch on which we can agree. A sketch in which everyone can see what we do, why we do it and how to contribute. Further detail will be developed at the college and division levels, and we have resolved to a yearly progress assessment and adaptation as the university evolves. But the key piece for our university to tackle its next 10 years with vision and intentionality is in place with this plan.
 
The strategic plan calls for UI to innovate and engage, to transform and to cultivate. No one could call our goals little. For instance, we plan to become Idaho's only Carnegie Foundation “R1” university for “highest research activity,” joining the very top 100 universities nationwide. Our plan also calls for enrollment growth <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=8f3406ba18&e=55d7947efc>  to 17,000 students, while maintaining the outstanding experience for which UI is known. Enrollment growth is a key driver for resources needed to fuel institutional plan objectives, and it’s also important for meeting Idaho’s Complete College Idaho goals for 60 percent postsecondary attainment.
 
Over the next nine years, I view our job as building one of the nation’s great public research universities. A university that excels in its broad, land-grant mission of transforming lives through education and scholarship. A university that leads Idaho in building a college-going culture <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=b6c97757de&e=55d7947efc>  that transforms the lives of individual students, assures the prosperity of families, and strengthens Idaho communities. A university that takes its place among top research universities <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=64d9ad88ed&e=55d7947efc> , not because we seek a particular label, but because we seek excellence and impact for our scholarship. A university that engages deeply with its constituents across the range of university activity. A “Beacon for Mountain and Plain.” <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=eefdd5306f&e=55d7947efc> 
 
We are not stone breakers. We are Vandals, and we are building something big.

State Board of Education Tours Moscow Campus

In Moscow for their regular meeting, members of the Idaho State Board of Education toured campus Wednesday <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=70bd5ea38e&e=55d7947efc> , getting a look at new and updated facilities and hearing from university experts. The tour included visits to the Integrated Research and Innovation Center, UI’s home for interdisciplinary research opening in spring 2017. The renovated College of Education was a stop, as board members viewed UI’s completely renovated facility for training the next generation of educators and movement science professionals. The group also visited the recently remodeled library. Board members also heard from student researchers about the UI undergraduate research program. At each stop, UI faculty and administration members explained the functions, need and value of each facility, along with bigger picture understandings of how UI prepares students for the future and how it uses research to address problems and discover new knowledge. “I’m grateful to the board members for taking the time to see the exciting developments on our campus,” said President Chuck Staben. “We’re proud to showcase the investments UI and the state are making in the excellence of Idaho’s leading, national research university.” 

UI Receives Grant for Online Fire Protection Training

The University of Idaho, Idaho Falls received a $244,000 grant from the Idaho Department of Labor to fund an online fire protection certificate program <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=3a4e35e595&e=55d7947efc>  starting this fall. Conducted by faculty and instructors in the College of Engineering’s existing Industrial Technology Program, the new courses will provide additional training for regional fire protection specialists and engineers, and the credits can be transferred into the UI fire ecology and management program. “There is currently a great need locally, in the state of Idaho, and nationally for fire protection specialists,” said Lee Ostrom, associate dean in the College of Engineering and director of academic programs at UI Idaho Falls. Accredited by the Association of Technology, Management, and Applied Engineering, the undergraduate program will consist of 18 credit hours, with six required three-credit classes, completed online in as little as three semesters. Topics include fire safety hazards analysis, fire suppression, community planning, fire protection and management, and structural designs for fire and life safety. Industry partners include Idaho Treatment Group, Battelle Energy Alliance, Walsh Engineering and CWI. 

Students Selected for Kennedy Center National Theater Festival

2016-04-22,The Friday Letter: New Opportunities To Build a Stronger Idaho,"April 22, 2016 	
 <https://gallery.mailchimp.com/e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef/images/78d0092c-6b67-41ab-8113-fb516677185b.jpg> 	
Dear Friends, 	
As Idaho’s statewide research institution <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=31b76d1057&e=55d7947efc> , the University of Idaho is in a special position to be responsive to the economic aspirations of our state. We live and work in a complex economy that includes vibrant agricultural, natural resources, technology and health care sectors. UI leverages expertise and resources to create a stronger Idaho for students, for employees, and for businesses who want to succeed with innovation and excellence.
 
Computer science is an area of strength at our university. We’re partnering with North Idaho College to allow students to transition from NIC to a four-year computer science degree <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=f43a5a0a6a&e=55d7947efc>  at UI Coeur d’Alene. Cybersecurity, software development and computer engineering are critical in the technology sector and across industries. This program is an important investment being made by our legislature in the workforce needs of our state, and we will carry it out effectively. For North Idaho, this transfer option follows on the creation of the Cybersecurity Operations and Training Center in Post Falls <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=073c6e47e8&e=55d7947efc> . Funded with an Idaho Department of Labor grant, the new center will train up to 350 people, including those currently in the workforce, in the next few years. 
 
Our faculty at the College of Engineering’s Center for Secure and Dependable Systems, led by Jim Alves-Foss, can attest to cybersecurity’s importance. Alves-Foss and his teammate Jia Song, a research assistant professor <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=330e3fb034&e=55d7947efc> , are competing in the DARPA Grand Cyber Challenge, having already bested some of the top experts and institutions in the world on their way to the finals later this year, with a $2 million grand prize at stake. We are proud to lead with expertise in this field.
 
In southeastern Idaho <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=8f97be3434&e=55d7947efc> , we have historically worked closely with the Idaho National Laboratory to train their workforce. We train employees and others toward bachelor’s degrees in industrial technology, environmental science and advanced degrees in STEM fields. Cybersecurity is an important component of this work, too. We also partner with INL to conduct research in everything from nuclear engineering to geothermal energy – research that will fuel growth and opportunity.
 
Lastly, I want to point out new work serving the agricultural teaching and research component of our land-grant mission for Idaho. Last week in Moscow, Idaho State Board of Education members heard a presentation about our Western Initiative for the Dairy Environment, <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=8731d7b125&e=55d7947efc>  a developing initiative that will support dairy production and processing in Idaho. Our state is third in the nation in dairy production, and the industry represents 30 percent of our agricultural economy. We have an opportunity to support a critical industry, but also to ensure a stable and sustainable supply of protein for our world.
 
We are a comprehensive university, and each of our academic and research functions engage directly and indirectly with the workforce and economic needs of our state. We will continue to look for opportunities to serve our state and the students who are our future employees, entrepreneurs and community leaders — in our farm fields, in our business offices and behind our computer screens.
 
I invite you to watch the video below, from our 2016 Research Report, to see more of our research impact for Idaho and the world.

Parrella as the 15th dean in the 115 years of the college. “We are confident that Dean Parrella will provide excellent leadership for CALS, and we are excited to work with him for the benefit of Idaho’s agriculture industry,” said President Wyatt Prescott. “We challenge alumni, faculty, staff and students to join the Food Producers of Idaho in meeting the goal of the Dean’s Excellence Fund.” The Food Producers of Idaho is comprised of numerous commodity, farm and agribusiness organizations united to communicate, educate and advocate on behalf of the agriculture industry in Idaho. Follow the CALS Facebook page <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=ed42f3b08b&e=55d7947efc>  for Match Day updates or contact Kim O’Neill, CALS assistant dean of advancement, at 208-885-8606 or kimoneill@uidaho.edu <mailto:kimoneill@uidaho.edu> . 

Five Teams Earn Vandal Ideas Project Grants

Proposals for neural modeling for brain research, enhancing education in a digital world, integrating evolution principles into video game design, improving scientific research through statistics, and uniting art and science rose to the top of a diverse field of projects to win the University of Idaho’s inaugural Vandal Ideas Project (VIP) grants <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=faa22c6490&e=55d7947efc> . Five teams of scholars and researchers from across colleges and disciplines have been awarded grants of between $40,000 and $80,000 through VIP, a competitive, university-wide grant program aimed at stimulating new research, creativity and scholarship. The VIP committee reviewed proposals with an eye for those that seemed most innovative, feasible and likely either to have a lasting impact within the university or to position UI to have an impact on a topic of regional or national relevance. President Chuck Staben made final decisions, based on committee recommendations. “We are excited and honored to invest in these projects that leap beyond the traditional boundaries of academia to create new knowledge, advance groundbreaking ideas and provide tangible benefits to our students, state and world,” Staben said. “These projects capture the spirit of creativity and innovation the University of Idaho seeks to foster.” 

UI Theater Returns to Russia for Summer Study 

University of Idaho faculty and 20 students within the College of Letters, Arts and Social Sciences will travel to Moscow, Russia <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=8d384956ae&e=55d7947efc> , this summer to study at the world famous Moscow Art Theatre. During the visit, the group will see close to 20 performances, as well as tour famous museums and cultural sights in Moscow and the surrounding area. In addition to training and studying Russian theater and culture, UI assistant professor Matt Foss and students will perform a site-specific production of Tennessee Williams’ “The Glass Menagerie” at the Moscow Art Theatre. The performance is funded by the Vandal Theatre Lab, a grant-funded initiative helping to create student and outreach focused work. The Moscow Art Theatre was the home of world-famous actor and director Konstantin Stanislavsky, premiered and made famous many works of Anton Chekhov, and maintains a tradition of modern actor training. The June trip is a collaboration between UI Theatre Arts, the Moscow Art Theatre School in Russia and Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan.

2016-04-29,The Friday Letter: The Future of UI Football,"April 29, 2016 	
 <https://gallery.mailchimp.com/e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef/images/78d0092c-6b67-41ab-8113-fb516677185b.jpg> 	
Dear Friends, 	
Yesterday we announced that the University of Idaho Vandal football team will accept an invitation to join the Big Sky Conference <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=2a4d16dd88&e=55d7947efc> , pending State Board of Education approval, starting in fall 2018. UI Athletics Director Rob Spear and Head Football Coach Paul Petrino respect and will implement this decision.
 
This is the right decision <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=cab5e7d2d3&e=55d7947efc>  for our students, for academic excellence and long-term success and stature of the University of Idaho. We are, first and foremost, the state's leading residential and research university. The experience of our students and growing our capacity to educate and innovate must be the focal point for all of our actions.  
 
I want to remind everyone what our choices, which we have evaluated over many months, were. We could: 

1.	Remain in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of Division I as an independent after 2017, waiting for an invitation to join an FBS conference; or
2.	Join the Big Sky Conference, in the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) of Division I, gaining full membership in that conference.

The key factors in making this decision were whether UI could realistically expect to become a competitive FBS team that would be asked to affiliate with a stable FBS conference, versus the value of joining the Big Sky.
 
UI has always been one of the lowest-resourced FBS football teams and has struggled to win. To become successful enough to affiliate with any FBS conference would entail unjustifiable, unsustainable expenditures with only a marginal chance of success. Enduring the significant challenges of competition as an independent weighed against an extremely uncertain future would be irresponsible when we have the alternative of joining one of the most stable FCS conferences that also allows us to renew traditional rivalries and offers our student-athletes the opportunity to excel at an appropriate level of competition, just as they do in our other Big Sky sports programs.
 
We are very proud of this year’s Big Sky Conference championships <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=44264ffa00&e=55d7947efc> : women’s basketball, women’s soccer and women’s golf. Our men’s and women’s tennis teams and men’s golf team are playing for championship titles this weekend. Our overall athletic program, under Rob Spear’s leadership, has excelled and will continue to do so.
 
We believe in the young men and the coaches on our Vandal football team. They have competed at a high level in the Sun Belt, and I know they will play well this coming fall and the next. Coach Petrino has done an outstanding job, and I am pleased that he is committed to staying with our program. But long-term, having no FBS conference affiliation option is problematic for recruitment, for rivalries that students and other fans get excited about, and poses little to no financial advantage. Continued instability will not help us build a program, and it holds back the university as a whole. Full membership in the Big Sky conference means we have a voice in all conference decisions and a seat at the table next to similar institutions in our geographic region. It is time to make this move.
 
I understand some alumni and supporters do not agree that an FCS affiliation is our best option. Many passionate Vandals view our place in FBS as a mark of our institution’s “prestige” and “relevance.” The University of Idaho is our state’s land-grant university, the unquestioned statewide leader in higher education. Success on the football field should complement the prestige and relevance of our academic institution, but not define it. Rather, the impact of our institution will define us, as measured by the entire experience for our student body, including student-athletes; by academic excellence <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=f83ba1e099&e=55d7947efc>  across the university; by sustained research <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=12c34f3cc9&e=55d7947efc> , scholarly activity and creative success; and by deep engagement with communities and partnerships with industry.
 
Over the past year, we have carefully considered our options, listening to alumni and other stakeholders, gathering input through face-to-face conversations, emails and letters, social media and more. We’ve conducted thorough due diligence through internal review and through a report conducted by an independent third-party analyst. We’ve estimated the costs and benefits of independence as they relate to positioning ourselves for the conference affiliation essential for our university to participate at any level of college football.  These estimates are both monetary and in terms of the total football experience for our university. Ultimately, that analysis suggests that the University of Idaho — our Athletics program, our student-athletes, our student body and fans, and our friends and supporters — are best served by a move to the Big Sky. We choose not to follow the faint hope of conference reorganizations, but to provide our athletes fair competition and the opportunity to succeed each time they step on the field.
 
This decision is without precedent in the modern era of college football. I see that a leap into new waters alarms those who care deeply about our university. But the Big Sky Conference is hardly unknown; we have a long history of success in the conference. Big Sky football is exciting and nationally competitive, and our fans will enjoy seeing familiar uniforms from around the region: Montana, Montana State and others. We are fortunate to have this option available. It is a change, though, so let us promise that together we will build a top-tier program that competes for championships. We will create an outstanding student-athlete and community-wide experience around our program, a vibrant football culture that provides a great front porch for Idaho’s leading, national research university, a draw for future students and a continued source of pride for current students.
 
I recognize this letter can’t answer all questions about this topic, and the move to the Big Sky entails many moving pieces, which we will address as they become clearer and as we have final plans. I also recognize the magnitude of this decision and the strong opinions that surround it, both for and against, but I am confident that joining the Big Sky Conference is the best possible course for our Athletics program and for our university. Of course, changes in the college athletics landscape may occur, and we will always seek the best opportunity for our students, student-athletes, and fans.
 
The university’s impact is felt every day by our 100,000 Vandal alumni <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=bb27318cd3&e=55d7947efc> . These women and men lead lives filled with meaning and opportunity. They exercise leadership in their communities and in their work. They are proud of their alma mater and give back so that others can have the same transformative experiences. I know some alumni will be disappointed by this decision. With the passionate support that separates the Vandal family from others, we are committed to a winning program in the Big Sky conference. I want all Vandals to experience success and pride, as part of a total University of Idaho experience that does right by its heritage, its land-grant mission and its future aspirations. That is the best formula for UI to assert its prestige and relevance — an impact that we will continue to grow <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=30631526ec&e=55d7947efc>  in the years ahead. Today more than at any time during my presidency, I need your support, and I know that, long term, I can count on it.

2016-05-06,The Friday Letter: Where a Vandal Education Can Take You,"May 6, 2016 	
 <https://gallery.mailchimp.com/e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef/images/78d0092c-6b67-41ab-8113-fb516677185b.jpg> 	
Dear Friends, 	
Where can a Vandal education take you? Just about anywhere on Earth — and in some cases, beyond. In April, we celebrated a “Month of Innovation” at UI, culminating with the College of Engineering Design EXPO <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=1742304951&e=55d7947efc>  last weekend. Each year at EXPO, we celebrate the capstone projects of our engineering students, invite high school students to campus, and connect with alumni and industry leaders who give their time as judges and advisors.
 
This year, UI welcomed back Tom Mueller, <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=3072765a6f&e=55d7947efc>  a graduate of the College of Engineering and a co-founding employee of SpaceX. If you’ve watched the news recently, you’ve likely heard of SpaceX and seen their work in action. This company is pioneering reusable rockets, seeming to make a major advance with each rocket launch.
 
Tom is from St. Maries, Idaho, in Benewah County, and the son of a logger. St. Maries is the gateway to the beautiful St. Joe River country, and a long way from SpaceX’s headquarters in Southern California. Yet, the University of Idaho was the launching pad for Tom’s career.
 
During EXPO, about 500 visiting high school students experienced a weekend that showcases life and work at UI and in the College of Engineering. They visited locations around the Moscow campus, met with students and faculty, and engaged in hands-on activities.
 
In addition to getting a taste of college life, these visiting students also got to see a UI engineering education in action, as more than 60 engineering seniors presented their capstone projects with booth presentations and technical presentations. Imagining, creating and refining a project is valuable, but so is the ability to communicate the importance of that work. The presentations are similar to TED talks, judged by industry and academic evaluators. Many evaluators were alumni who volunteered their time and insight and we appreciate their particular expertise and encouragement to our students.
 
Other Month of Innovation <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=f83e0ef480&e=55d7947efc>  programs, events and initiatives included a student-organized TEDx event; an Undergraduate Research Symposium; the UI’s first Three-Minute Thesis competition and the Innovation Showcase through our College of Graduate Studies. The College of Business and Economics hosted Idaho Pitch and business plan contests, during which more than $30,000 was awarded to student-conceived business enterprises.
 
The entire month served to highlight that at UI, our students encounter new ideas and are encouraged to find fresh approaches across disciplines, and to have opportunities to refine those ideas through presentation and competition.
 
These experiences are critical elements of a transformative education. They help current students — and our future students — get a better picture of the possibilities and opportunities that come with a college education: the great heights a world-class education can propel them to. They, like Tom Mueller, can reach for the stars.

TRIO-INSPIREs the Future for Idaho’s Students

Growing up in a rural southern Idaho county where only 26.5 percent of residents hold at least an associate degree, the odds were against Robin Miller making it to college. At age 11, she became involved in TRIO-INSPIRE <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=a77a070fec&e=55d7947efc> , an outreach program committed to providing educational opportunities for Americans regardless of race, ethnic background or economic status. Her involvement continued as a high school freshman when she joined the Upward Bound Math Science program, one of seven TRIO programs offered through the University of Idaho. “Without TRIO’s help, I wouldn’t have been able to attend college, or even know how to fill out a FAFSA or a college application,” said Robin. Now a successful college graduate working in computer science, Robin gives to UI’s TRIO Excellence Fund to support the program that made the critical difference in her life. To make a gift to TRIO, contact James Brownson at 208-885-5369 or jbrownson@uidaho.edu. <mailto:jbrownson@uidaho.edu>  

Alumna Makes National Case for a UI Education

In a HuffPost College article published Tuesday, <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=8297a088da&e=55d7947efc>  UI alumna Elaine Ambrose ’73, a former national president of the UI Alumni Association and Foundation board member, joined the national debate on the rising costs of a college education, student loans, and the value of degrees earned in-state compared to Ivy League institutions: “Most states have excellent universities and trade schools that offer less expensive choices, especially for the first two years when students take required core classes. Parents who own property are paying the taxes to support those schools, so why pay out-of-state tuition somewhere else? Often, the state universities have excellent job placement records, and isn’t that the reason students attend? … My college experience gave me freedom and opportunities that changed my life as I focused on one main goal: work at a rewarding job, support myself and use my talents to live the best life possible. Go, Idaho.”  

Faculty Members Earn National Recognition

Two University of Idaho faculty members have received the National Science Foundation’s most prestigious award for early career scholars. Tara Hudiburg, an assistant professor of forest science in the UI College of Natural Resources, and Craig McGowan, an assistant professor of biological sciences in the UI College of Science, earned Faculty Early Career Development <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=ead06c3746&e=55d7947efc>  (CAREER) awards, and through them a combined $1.7 million in research funding. According to the National Science Foundation, CAREER awards support faculty “who exemplify the role of teacher-scholars through outstanding research, excellent education and the integration of education and research within the context of the mission of their organizations.” Faculty propose projects and apply for the award. 

1,556 Students Statewide Eligible to Graduate

2016-05-13,The Friday Letter: The World Needs Vandals,"May 13, 2016 	
 <https://gallery.mailchimp.com/e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef/images/78d0092c-6b67-41ab-8113-fb516677185b.jpg> 	
Dear Friends, 	
This week and next, we celebrate the accomplishments of students across our state, as more than 1,500 Vandals cross the stage as graduates <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=5ecfe280d5&e=55d7947efc> . Each has contributed greatly to the vibrant cultural and academic climate of our university. We know that whether they’ve earned a bachelor’s, master’s or doctoral degree, these students are better prepared to live outstanding lives <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=cad7ad72ae&e=55d7947efc> . Our graduates today take their place in a proud history and a forward-looking mission, as alumni of Idaho’s leading, national research university.
 
Over the course of their UI experience, graduates took on new experiences, met difficult challenges and made the most of life-changing opportunities. They have practiced critical inquiry and opened their minds to new ideas. They have engaged in hands-on research, scholarly activity and creative work alongside professors and mentors who are leading their disciplines. Our students have also offered leadership and service that makes a difference and lives up to our ideals as Vandals.
 
I encourage you to visit our website to learn and share our graduates’ stories <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=dc87311071&e=55d7947efc> . Among our graduates today is Kelly Christensen, who has used her time at UI to engage deeply with academic work, to learn about herself, and to discover her potential for life and work filled with purpose and inspiration. She’s currently finishing an undergraduate research project <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=74eec71768&e=55d7947efc>  that takes an interdisciplinary route to use math to understand and fight disease — fascinating work on the precipice of a promising career. Kelly is a student ambassador for the College of Science and she participates in UI Science Outreach, bringing the excitement of science to area elementary and middle school students. I’m proud of how she’s represented science and the University of Idaho to future scientists — and future Vandals.
 
Tomorrow we’ll also congratulate Joe Vandal on his graduation. Joe, our beloved mascot, is not actually walking across the stage, but the person who has brought him to life <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=5e554e95c6&e=55d7947efc>  for four years is. Behind the mask, you’ve seen College of Natural Resources graduate student Rob Gibson at countless events, celebrations and gatherings over the years, bringing energy and enthusiasm to our school. Also the drum major for the Vandal marching band, Rob helped stir life and passion for our institution. Rob epitomizes what it means to be a member of a tribe from the North, brave and bold.
 
Each of our graduates has a story of success — challenges met, obstacles overcome and aspirations realized. As I have been telling our graduates, that experience positions them to succeed <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=78a3154ffc&e=55d7947efc> . Our global economy needs critical thinkers, innovators and risk takers. Employers need skilled, creative, diligent, conscientious people — and they look to our university to find them. Communities need leaders and volunteers, women and men committed to the public good.
 
In short, the world needs Vandals.

Walmart Foundation Supports Healthy Eating After-school Program

4-H Food Smart Families in Idaho, part of the University of Idaho Extension’s Eat Smart Idaho program, received financial nourishment from the Walmart Foundation to deliver the program to youth at the Caldwell Housing Authority’s Farmway Village. In a 2015 survey, 70 percent of Farmway Village residents indicated the need for after-school programming and 60 percent were interested in programs on healthy eating, cooking and physical activity. Food Smart Families responds to these needs. Directed by Maureen Toomey, UI Extension program specialist, Food Smart Families enlists 4-H Youth Development teen members to co-teach classes regarding healthy food choices, grocery budgeting, safe preparation and cooking strategies to children in grades four through 12. “If we get kids to have a voice, then they can influence the family eating and activity level,” Toomey said. “Kids making positive, healthy choices help their family members live longer, healthier lives.” For more information on partnering with UI, contact Casey Hanson at 208-885-7053 or caseyh@uidaho.edu <mailto:caseyh@uidaho.edu> .  

Vandals Win Fulbright Awards

2016-05-20,The Friday Letter: Students at the Center of Our Academic Excellence,"May 20, 2016 	
 <https://gallery.mailchimp.com/e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef/images/78d0092c-6b67-41ab-8113-fb516677185b.jpg> 	
Dear Friends, 	
Summer is a great time to celebrate the accomplishments of our students. We take pride in providing opportunities for student success through access to a comprehensive, high quality education. While I can’t highlight every deserving student, I want to mention a few whose achievements embody the excellence of our university <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=aa6feb4ce2&e=55d7947efc> .
 
Vandals are leading the way in distinguished, national awards. This spring Alyssa Ertel, a third-year honors program student from Kennewick, Washington, earned a prestigious Goldwater Scholarship <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=d78790cec6&e=55d7947efc> . That award supports careers in science, mathematics and engineering. Alyssa, a student of chemical engineering and chemistry, is one of only 252 new Goldwater scholars nationwide this year. UI has had 11 students earn this award over the past decade.
 
UI also had numerous recipients this year of the Benjamin A. Gilman Scholarship, a competitive scholarship given to only 2,700 recipients nationwide. Sponsored by the U.S. State Department, the scholarship supports international study and internship opportunities. In the fall, sophomores Emily and Jordan Kizer used their scholarships to live and learn in Peru. Samuel Hermann, a senior international studies major from Genesee, Idaho, participated in a research project in Senegal. This spring junior Clarisa Lopez, a clothing, textile and design major, went to France. Joshua Warnick from Coeur d’Alene, Idaho, went to Morocco. We’ll have two more Gilman scholars this summer: William Juarez-Tapia, from Filer, Idaho, is going to China, and Lauren Hirsch from Fair Oaks, California, is bound for Russia. I’m excited about the academic and cultural opportunities they’ll experience, and the perspectives they’ll be able to share with their classmates when they return to UI.
 
We also applaud the work of Katey Huggler, a senior in wildlife resources from Priest River, Idaho, who earned a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship, a great step toward future study and an exciting career. Two Vandals have won Fulbright U.S. Student Awards <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=d65d18792d&e=55d7947efc> : Anna Cantrell, from Bruneau, Idaho, will travel to Nepal for an English teaching assistantship, and Anthony St. Claire of Coeur d’Alene will travel to Senegal for an English teaching assistantship. 
 
Our University Honors Program <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=7c4ad40502&e=55d7947efc>  takes the lead in connecting students with many of these scholarships. Approximately 500 students, in all colleges and undergraduate majors, participate in the program. There are many opportunities for mentorship, peer support and involvement in everything from undergraduate research to volunteerism. The program is an invaluable part of the academic life of our research university.
 
These honors show the high caliber of students we have here at UI. We once again led the Northwest in the number of National Merit Scholars <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=55f402110a&e=55d7947efc>  who chose UI as freshmen, with 23 of Idaho’s 24 scholars. These students are in the top 1 percent of high school students and pass a rigorous course of tests to become National Merit finalists. In addition, we’ll be joined next fall by a new Gates Millennium Scholar, Enrique Gutierrez from Parma, Idaho. It is a point of pride that these talented students choose the University of Idaho to prepare them for life and work. They enhance the academic vitality of UI for all students on their way to further distinction in the paths they take as Vandals.
 
We also have many students who are accomplishing great things in other ways. That includes the many students who volunteer in their communities and through programs like our Alternative Service Breaks. It includes those who take leadership roles in student government and in fraternity and sorority life. It includes those who excel in scholarship and creative work. And it certainly includes the many students who have overcome challenges of all kinds and found their way forward through higher education at the state’s leading, national research university. I congratulate our students on their success, and wish them well in their future as graduates and as citizens.

Late Alumna, UI Extension Professional Honored

Lydia Clayton ’04, ’09 committed her life to producing food sustainably and educating others. As a student, she served as the manager for the Soil Stewards Farm and following graduation became a University of Idaho Extension educator in Lewiston. After her unexpected passing in August 2014, friends, family and community members, along with UI Extension and the Soil Stewards, donated funds to build a pole barn on the Soil Stewards Farm to honor Lydia’s short, but impactful life. The structure will be built this summer and will provide storage, along with a sheltered area for Extension classes. “This barn will serve as a way to honor Lydia’s life and passion, while providing a great benefit to our students and community,” said Barbara Petty, University of Idaho Extension interim director. Additional donations are being raised to support a Soil Stewards Farm manager internship in Lydia’s memory. For information on giving, contact Kim O’Neill, CALS assistant dean of advancement, at 208-885-8606 or kimoneill@uidaho.edu <mailto:kimoneill@uidaho.edu> .   

UI Part of Grant to Evaluate Health Care Model

A team of researchers led by the University of Idaho is embarking on a three-year, $2.9 million project <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=6d1346f980&e=55d7947efc>  to evaluate an innovative model of health care being tested throughout Idaho. The Idaho Department of Health & Welfare (IDHW) awarded the contract after a competitive process. Researchers from UI, the Idaho WWAMI Medical Education Program and Boise State University will evaluate the model test of the Statewide Healthcare Innovation Plan, or SHIP, to allow IDHW to make adjustments. The SHIP system supports transformation of primary care through coordinated teams of providers focused on individual patients’ needs. In 2016, 55 medical practices in Idaho adopted the program, which will expand to 165 practices over the next two years and include regional and statewide oversight and support. 

Researchers Examine Evolution with NSF Support

University of Idaho faculty members in the Institute for Bioinformatics and Evolutionary Studies (IBEST) have been awarded $504,818 <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=e077358439&e=55d7947efc>  this year in new competitive grants as part of the National Science Foundation’s BEACON Science and Technology Center on Evolution in Action. UI researchers have now been awarded more than $3.8 million through BEACON in the past seven years. IBEST is an interdisciplinary research group at UI focused on understanding the patterns and processes of evolution that occur over comparatively short periods of time.  

Professor Wins NEH Support to Study Impact of Memorials

A University of Idaho writer and English faculty member will spend the summer exploring and analyzing National Park Service memorials across the West, funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities Summer Stipends program <http://uidaho.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e8b26a2bfdf3335ca7d0c9eef&id=160bd83aed&e=55d7947efc> . Jennifer Ladino, an associate professor of English in the College of Letters, Arts and Social Sciences, will visit the Golden Spike National Historic Site in Utah and the San Juan Island National Historic Park in Washington as research for her scholarly book project, “Memorials Matter,” investigating how National Park Service memorials in the American West influence emotions about historical conflict and national identity. “The idea is to examine the natural and built environment in these places, to analyze how they affect tourists on an emotional level,” Ladino said. Ladino was the only 2016 NEH grant recipient from Idaho.

2016-08-19,Why UI is the Best Choice,"<p></p> 
<p>This morning, a brand new class of Vandals comes together at <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/events/university-convocation/?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=081916&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=Convocation&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" target=""_blank"">Convocation</a>, the annual tradition marking the beginning of our academic year and the start of each student’s educational journey. It can be a time filled with trepidation for students — and for parents. Yesterday I had the opportunity to meet students and parents moving into our residence halls. I saw young women and men wondering what college is all about. I also saw students excited to embark on an adventure, ready to take charge of their futures with a college degree.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> There is no better way to take charge of your future than to join the Vandal family.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Recently, Money magazine named the University of Idaho the <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/ti.me/29Jv9q8 ']);"" href=""http://ti.me/29Jv9q8%20"" target=""_blank"">“</a><a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/ti.me/29Jv9q8 ']);"" href=""http://ti.me/29Jv9q8%20"" target=""_blank"">Best College” in our state</a><a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/ti.me/29Jv9q8 ']);"" href=""http://ti.me/29Jv9q8%20"" target=""_blank"">,</a> based on our winning combination of affordability, academic excellence and outcomes after college. The publication notes our <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/degree-finder/?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=081916&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=DegreeFinder&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" target=""_blank"">broad range of academic offerings</a>, in everything from agricultural research to natural resources to music and the arts. Money joins the <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/1.usa.gov/1pbIdGD']);"" href=""http://1.usa.gov/1pbIdGD"" target=""_blank"">College Scorecard</a> in highlighting our success for students: outstanding educational opportunities, robust financial aid and graduate earnings that are the highest of any institution in Idaho.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> I’m highlighting post-graduation outcomes — that might seem like a long way down the road for our Convocation attendees. But career success is top of mind for many, as increasingly students are focused on college as a way to get a well-paying job. That’s a smart outlook, as studies show a college degree is the key to earning &nbsp;$1 million more over a lifetime than those with only a high school degree. Some <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/bit.ly/2bor8GP ']);"" href=""http://bit.ly/2bor8GP%20"" target=""_blank"">95 percent of all new jobs</a> created since the Great Recession have gone to those with at least some college experience. University of Idaho <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/bit.ly/1RCpFeO ']);"" href=""http://bit.ly/1RCpFeO%20"" target=""_blank"">graduates lead the way</a> among our state’s institutions when it comes to mid-career salaries — it’s not even close. That financial stability underpins a great life for UI grads.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> On their way to graduation, though, I hope students will treasure the unique experiences they have to grow as thinkers, as leaders, and as members of a caring community. Many Vandals have the chance to participate in <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/research/students/undergraduate-research/?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=081916&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=UndergraduateResearch&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter1"" target=""_blank"">hands-on research</a>. They learn and receive mentorship from the best and brightest faculty members. They have unparalleled access to <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/campus-recreation/outdoor-program/?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=081916&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=Outdoor%20Program&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16%20"" target=""_blank"">outdoor adventure</a>.

As I’ll tell our students this morning: A lot happens here on the way to the rest of your life. Take advantage of every minute of it.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> We’re proud to be joined at our Convocation by Hattie Kauffman, an award-winning journalist who will share her inspirational story. Ms. Kauffman, a member of the Nez Perce Tribe, was born in Idaho and has deep roots in the area. She is a trailblazing journalist and author, and a great example of the success one can have through higher education. I’m grateful that Ms. Kauffman could be with us in Moscow today, and I hope the newest members of our Vandal family gain a&nbsp;better idea of what is possible in college and in life — as a student, as a graduate and as a person.<br /> <br /> Go Vandals!<br /> <br /> Chuck Staben<br /> President<br /> <br /> </p>

2016-08-26,Kicking Off Our Vandal Football Season,"<p></p> 
<p>On Thursday, Sept. 1, <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/tkt.xosn.com/tickets/TicketHome.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=17100 ']);"" href=""https://tkt.xosn.com/tickets/TicketHome.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=17100"" target=""_blank"">our Vandal football season</a> kicks off at the Kibbie Dome. I've often referred to our Athletics program as the “front porch” of the university — the place where we come together to celebrate our heritage, our current work and our bright future. I’m confident we’ll also get to see a great game as the Montana State Bobcats come to town.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> A lot has happened since our last football game. I made the difficult decision to affiliate our program with the Big Sky Conference after the 2017 season. One exciting factor in the conference change was the opportunity for regional rivalries. As a current Big Sky team, our neighboring land-grant, research institution across the mountains in Bozeman provides an example of the regional match-ups that we hope will create enthusiasm among our fans and make the University of Idaho's story more visible.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Our student-athletes are ambassadors for that story of excellence. As the father of two NCAA athletes myself, I have seen the dedication and commitment it takes to be successful. Juggling academics and athletics is not an easy proposition, especially at the Division I level, but our Vandal athletes work hard to maintain excellence on and off the field. Last year, 24 football players made either the Academic Honor Roll or the Commissioner’s List for their conference. Across other sports in fall and winter, 55 student-athletes earned Big Sky Conference All-Academic honors, with more to come when the spring results are tallied.&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;<br /> For student-athletes, that hard work pays off. They are <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/www.linkedin.com/pulse/forget-just-being-well-rounded-have-depth-breadth-jeff-selingo']);"" href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/forget-just-being-well-rounded-have-depth-breadth-jeff-selingo"" target=""_blank"">highly valued by employers</a> for their work ethic, ability to focus and commitment to task completion. Our Vandals who don’t go pro in their sports — plenty do, I should point out — join the rest of the Vandal family in contributing as leaders and innovators in industries and organizations across the nation and the world.&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Our faculty and staff contribute to that success. In appreciation for that service, my office has collaborated with the Athletics Ticket Office to offer <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/faculty-staff-news/2016-august/082316-freefootballtix/?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=082616&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=FootballTickets&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" target=""_blank"">two free tickets to the Sept. 1 game</a> for our Vandal employees. Additional tickets can be purchased for just $5. Thank you to all UI employees for contributing to the excellence of the University of Idaho.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> I hope to see as many Vandals as possible in the <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/events/idaho-fan-zone"" target=""_blank"">Idaho Fan Zone</a>, coming together to root on our student-athletes. We will set up on the SprinTurf just east of the dome with live music, great food and plenty of activities for kids. The <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/class/music/ensembles/marching-band/?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=082616&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=VandalMarchingBand&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" target=""_blank"">Vandal Marching Band</a> will offer its customarily rousing, occasionally irreverent routine to get us energized. Admission to the Fan Zone is free — just come ready to have fun and cheer on our team as it heads into the season, representing the best of the Vandal spirit.</p>

2016-09-02,Important Changes for College-Bound Students,"<p></p> 
<p>The University of Idaho remains committed to bringing more students — especially Idaho students — into the life-changing, career-shaping experience of higher education. That has been a central goal of my presidency. This fall we are rolling out ways to make getting to college easier and paying for college more affordable.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> First: <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/admissions/first-year/admission-requirements/?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=090216&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=AdmissionRequirements&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" target=""_blank"">We are eliminating the application fee for Idaho residents</a>. This $60 charge typically accompanies completion of the necessary paperwork to claim one’s spot at the university. But I want to continue streamlining the application process to ensure Idaho students have access to the best university in our state. While $60 may be a small hurdle, it is a hurdle nonetheless. We don’t want students to trip up on those critical first steps toward a college degree, a rewarding career and a great life.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Second, we are excited about the state’s Direct Admit program, offering high school students automatic admission to Idaho’s public colleges and universities, based on their academic qualifications. Students should expect a letter soon from the state informing them of their choices and <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/bit.ly/1P1Ddip ']);"" href=""http://bit.ly/1P1Ddip%20"" target=""_blank"">next steps</a>. The University of Idaho will follow up with those students, offering guidance on how to complete the process and get started with a Vandal education.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Those steps are about getting to college. What about paying for college? An important change students and parents should be aware of is the ability to take advantage of the <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/financial-aid/apply-for-aid/dates-and-deadlines/?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=090216&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=FinancialAid&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" target=""_blank"">new Oct. 1 FAFSA date</a>. This has important ramifications for financial aid. Instead of waiting until next spring’s tax filing deadline, families can now complete the 2017-18 FAFSA starting October 1, using their previous year’s (2015) income information. (You may see this change referred to as “early FAFSA” or “prior-prior year” reporting.) Families will have more clarity, sooner, about what to expect in financial support.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Our university is moving its <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/financial-aid/apply-for-aid/dates-and-deadlines/?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=090216&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=FinancialAid&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" target=""_blank"">priority date for financial aid</a> up from February 15 to December 1. Students who have completed the application process (and Idaho students who have completed the Direct Admit process) will begin to receive notice of their financial awards as soon as mid-December. While students can still qualify for scholarships and financial aid after December 1, we want as many families as possible to be aware of their financial aid packages before the holiday season.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Each student and family should have as much information as possible, and as much time as possible to digest it, to make a good choice about college.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The University of Idaho is our state’s leader in educational quality and in college affordability: <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/1.usa.gov/1pbIdGD ']);"" href=""http://1.usa.gov/1pbIdGD%20"" target=""_blank"">value that makes UI a great choice</a>. UI awarded <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2016-july/071116-scholarships/?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=090216&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=Scholarships&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" target=""_blank"">$25 million in scholarships</a>&nbsp;this fall, more than any other public institution in the state. More than $8 million of that support came from gifts and endowments thanks to the contributions of Vandal alumni and friends. Scholarship support helped families across the income spectrum make college a reality – for instance,&nbsp;we helped more than 4,000 Idaho students with family incomes averaging $41,000 afford tuition and fees, room and board, and books.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The best ambassador for the value of a Vandal education is the success of our graduates. Getting in to college and making it affordable can be daunting, but we know that it pays off for students and is essential in today’s world. Vandal alumni, please help us spread the word about these exciting changes and the value of your experience at UI.<br /> <br /> Go Vandals!<br /> Chuck Staben</p>

2016-09-09,Meet Our New Research Leader,"<p></p> 
<p class=""p1"">Janet Nelson joined us this month as our new vice president for research and economic development. She was most recently the associate vice chancellor for research development at the University of Tennessee and has more than 30 years of experience in scientific research and administration.</p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>Over the next few weeks&nbsp;she will be touring Idaho to visit&nbsp;agencies, industry partners and UI locations. I interviewed Janet this week to capture firsthand her thoughts on the <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/research/?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=090916&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=Research&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"">role of research</a>, on the importance of expert teams, and on moving to Idaho and returning to her roots in the West.</span></p> 
<p class=""p2""><strong><span>Why did you want to work at the University of Idaho?</span></strong></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>Every time I visited the University of Idaho, I became more impressed with the opportunities at the university, the beauty of the region and the warmth of the people. I was actually born in Bozeman, Montana, and I spent many summers at my grandfather’s ranch in Dillon. It is fun to be out West again. The opportunity to join the senior leadership in place here was also a key part of my decision.</span></p> 
<p class=""p2""><strong><span>How has your experience in science and research administration prepared you for this role?</span></strong></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>Like the University of Tennessee, Idaho is a land-grant university and a flagship university. The research and development aspects of this position will be quite similar to what I’ve been doing the past few years at UT. For example, to grow the NIH portfolio, I worked with the faculty to strategically go after NIH funding. I also have extensive history at DOE national labs, from my postdoctoral training at Los Alamos National Laboratory, to five years at the National Energy Technology Laboratory, to fostering partnerships between UT and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. I really enjoy building relationships and helping the academic, government and industry continuum leverage their different research strengths to attack a problem in a common way.</span></p> 
<p class=""p1""><strong><span>One of UI’s goals, as spelled out in our new Strategic Plan, is to become a Carnegie R1 “Highest Research Activity” institution. What will that take?</span></strong></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>I’m very excited about the university’s new <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/provost/strategic-plan/?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=090916&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=StrategicPlan&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"">strategic plan</a>. It’s very aggressive, but I think it’s achievable. We’re going to have to roll up our sleeves, but a lot of the resources are currently in place. However, we will need improvement in infrastructure, in laboratory space and in cluster hires in areas of expertise. We’re going to have to work at growing different sources of research funding, and not just relying on federal expenditures. One thing to be careful about is that we can’t be the best at everything. We’re going to have to be selective about where we focus.</span></p> 
<p class=""p2""><strong><span>Why should the general public care about research? What does it mean for an Idahoan?</span></strong></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>Research is key to the mission of a land-grant university. I see a tight integration between education, research and economic development. I think research comes down to understanding how things work and then applying that knowledge to address a common problem. People in Idaho, just like people in the rest of the nation and the rest of the world, all have common problems, whether it’s health disparities, energy shortages or food issues. So the <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/research/news/research-reports/2016/?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=090916&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=ResearchReport&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"">research we do at universities</a>, and the work we can take to the next level and commercialize, is important in helping solve and address these challenges.</span></p> 
<p class=""p2""><strong><span></span></strong></p> 
<strong> </strong> 
<p class=""p1""><strong>Your description of research seems to go beyond the laboratory. Do you have a broad definition of research?</strong></p> 
<p><strong></strong></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>Yes. I embrace all research, scholarship and creative activity, and I’m going to make a point to address that intensely. I’m a chemist by training, but I’m very proud of having a BA from a liberal arts college. We have to understand that the standards for excellence for each&nbsp;discipline is different. For instance, a <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/bit.ly/2bVZA7F']);"" href=""http://bit.ly/2bVZA7F"" target=""_blank"">Guggenheim fellowship</a> is as prestigious as an <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/research/news/featured-research/2016/nsf-career-awards/?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=090916&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=NSFCareerAwards&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"">NSF CAREER Award</a>. Part of my responsibility is to celebrate excellence in each of the fields and help all the fields progress.</span></p> 
<p class=""p2""><strong><span>What themes do you see emerging in research?</span></strong></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>One of the things that I’m really passionate about with research is the emerging national theme of multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research. We have a great opportunity at UI to embrace this approach to tackle problems that one discipline alone can’t solve. For example, the food, water, energy nexus is going to bring together many disciplines and require a team effort. I really like team building, and it is important to understand that an expert team is not the same as a team of experts. I want to help build expert teams to help solve important problems.</span></p> 
<p class=""p2""><strong><span>You brought your family here. How are they feeling about this move?</span></strong></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>I have a grown daughter in North Carolina, but I brought my husband and my young daughter here, and they are very excited about the move and we are all enjoying Moscow and the region.</span></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>Thank you, Janet, for your time, and welcome again to our national research university.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> Go Vandals!<br /> <br /> Chuck Staben<br /> President</span><br /> <br /> </p>

2016-09-16,The Best Campus is a Safe Campus,"<p></p> 
<p>The University of Idaho has always stood out for having a distinctive residential campus. Among our historic buildings and modern facilities, students find a living and learning environment that facilitates growth and success. To reach that potential, a safe, supportive environment is paramount. Safety is a consideration at all our locations across the state, but with the majority of our students coming to live in Moscow, the residential campus requires a particular focus.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> In the upcoming week, we affirm our values as a caring community and renew our commitment to look out for our new and continuing students. This Sunday, UI's&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/events/safety-week/schedule/?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=091616&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=SafetyWeek&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" target=""_blank"">Safety Week</a> and Hazing Prevention Week begins, connecting students with tools and resources, expert advice and best practices, and an understanding of the support offered by UI faculty and staff, as well as fellow students. For the fourth consecutive year, new full-time students will complete our <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/orientation/think-about-it/?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=091616&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=ThinkAboutIt&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" target=""_blank"">“Think About It”</a> course, a mandatory orientation seminar that provides an interactive examination of relationships, substance abuse and violence. Two additional events — the Katy Benoit Safety Forum and a keynote address on hazing — are just a couple of examples of the opportunities to come together and focus on critical safety issues. I encourage our students to take advantage of these learning experiences.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Our participation in the national <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/student-affairs/dean-of-students/violence-prevention/green-dot/?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=091616&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=GreenDot&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" target=""_blank"">Green Dot</a> program offers techniques and training for realistic bystander intervention in situations with potential for interpersonal violence. On Sunday, UI is <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2016-september/091216-safetyweek/?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=091616&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=GreenDot&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" target=""_blank"">joining 50 other institutions nationwide</a> in a simultaneous Green Dot training. I want to also highlight the annual <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/diversity/dhr/womens-center/events/take-back-the-night/?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=091616&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=TakeBackTheNight&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" target=""_blank"">Take Back the Night</a> rally, hosted by the Women’s Center. Mary Beth will participate in that event and is looking forward to sharing her experiences as a physician and discussing solutions with UI students and staff – women and men alike. Safety Week events key in on the <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/vandal-health-education/i-got-your-back/?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=091616&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=IGotYourBack&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" target=""_blank"">“I Got Your Back”</a> concept and affirm that we Vandals support and take care of each other.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> A safe campus also requires a modern and dependable infrastructure. Last year, we made an investment in new cameras across our public spaces and at the entrances to some of our shared spaces. These cameras complement our existing security, and are investments in deterrence and accountability for our entire campus community.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The practices, perspectives and emphasis on resources and support goes beyond Safety Week. This is a commitment we must live out every day, continually assessing and improving our efforts. I can speak from personal experience as a parent, having delivered two sons and a daughter to college, that safety is a weighty consideration. As a president, that perspective keeps me focused on making sure all our students have an outstanding educational experience, and that the best residential campus in Idaho is also the safest residential campus in Idaho.</p>

2016-09-23,Sneak Peek at New Book of UI History,"<p></p> 
<p>There is no place quite like the University of Idaho. We have a special story to tell as an outstanding institution with a proud history and a bright future. A new book, &quot;University of Idaho: The Campus History Series,&quot; by Erin Passehl-Stoddart, head of Special Collections and Archives at the UI Library, and Katherine G. Aiken, a history professor in the College of Letters, Arts and Social Sciences, offers a photographic exploration of our institution’s history and current life. Vandals familiar with histories like “A Beacon for Mountain and Plain” by Rafe Gibbs or “This Crested Hill” by Keith Petersen will find this new effort a worthy companion.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The photos showcased span the 127 years of Idaho’s leading national research university. You’ll view a journey across the rich student life, research and scholarship, academic excellence, and Athletics success at UI.

2016-09-30,Three Stories of Vandal Spirit and Success,"<p></p> 
<p class=""p1"">At our 108th Homecoming this weekend, our <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/events/signature-events/homecoming?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=093016&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=Homecoming&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"">“Joe for the Gold”</a> theme nods at this summer’s Olympics and UI’s excellence in preparing graduates for success. It has been a fun week filled with spirit competitions, our 67th annual blood drive, the annual Serpertine tonight and more. I’m looking forward to joining Vandals from near and far tomorrow at the parade and football game.</p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>As I have worked at UI, I have been struck by the passion of our alumni. In particular, for many alumni, the Vandal spirit is handed down through generations — a family tradition of an outstanding academic experience that leads to great careers and great lives. I want to highlight three stories that exemplify that multi-generational Vandal success story.</span></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>Being a University of Idaho Vandal is a point of pride for Lieutenant Governor Brad Little and his wife, Teresa Soulen Little. The Littles are both native Idahoans and second-generation Vandals who followed in their parents’ footsteps to attend UI. Brad earned his degree in agribusiness, then put that degree to work helping to run his family ranch in Emmett. He and Teresa are proud that their two sons carried on the family tradition and also became Vandals. The Littles have served on several UI boards and participate in UI activities; in fact, it isn’t unusual to see the family together in Moscow cheering on the Vandal football team. Brad will be back in Moscow — his “home-away-from-home” — to participate in this weekend’s Homecoming activities, including the parade through downtown. The Littles are hoping to see their five grandchildren one day make their way down Hello Walk on their own journey toward a UI diploma.</span></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>Patty and Mike Fery, from Boise, are also multi-generational Vandals who care about giving back to UI. Patty, a communications graduate, has worked in marketing for high-profile Idaho companies. A dedicated Vandal volunteer, she helped reinvigorate our Parent and Family Association, offering <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/student-affairs/parents?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=093016&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=Parents&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"">information, resources and support</a> for Vandal families. Her mother and father were UI graduates, in accounting and architecture, respectively. Mike serves on the Foundation board, and their children are following their example as Vandals, with one joining the ranks of our alumni and another soon to follow. Having had the good fortune to get know the Ferys, I especially admire Patty’s strong interest in helping students with learning disabilities succeed in school, and am glad we share that interest in helping all students flourish.<br /> <br /> One more multi-generational success story, appropriate for this weekend. Flip Kleffner was our director of <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/alumni?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=093016&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=AlumniOffice&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"">Alumni Relations</a> for 15 years; he and his wife, Jo, were named “Idaho Treasures” in 2007. Vandal football fans recall that Flip, an Athletics Hall of Fame member, kicked an 82-yard punt against Washington State University in 1953. The Kleffners have generously supported the College of Education building renovation. They have also seen their five children and six grandchildren attend UI. I’ve met the Kleffners and am proud of their friendship and grateful for their continued support of UI.</span></p> We have many 
<p> Vandals, of course, who are the first generation in their family to attend UI, or to attend any institution. A UI degree positions graduates for long-term success, so I welcome all our new Vandals to start a family tradition of their own. For Vandals old and new, this will always be a place to come home to.</p> 
<span> Go Vandals!<br /> <br /> Chuck Staben<br /> President<br /> <br /> P.S.: Are you a multi-generation Vandal family? Share your story with us, we’d love to hear it. We may post it at my Facebook page, <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/www.facebook.com/uidahopresident']);"" href=""http://www.facebook.com/uidahopresident"" target=""_blank"">www.facebook.com/uidahopresident</a>.

2016-10-07,Big Goals from Our State of the University,"<p>This week I delivered my third <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/president/communications/presentations?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=100716&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=StateOfTheUniversity&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" target=""_blank"">State of the University address</a> as a Vandal. I shared with our faculty and staff, along with our supporters and friends, the success we’ve had in the past year.&nbsp; I also shared the goals and initiatives of our <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/provost/strategic-plan?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=100716&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=StrategicPlan&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" target=""_blank"">Strategic Plan</a>, the basis of an exciting future for our students and our state.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> We set ambitious goals for innovation at UI – the research, scholarly activity and creative work that makes an impact in Idaho and beyond. As a broad institutional goal, we have our sights set on R1 “Highest Research Activity” status by 2025, a standard for comparing institutions published by the Carnegie Classification. UI is already Idaho’s only R2 “higher research activity” university. Joining the research elite by becoming R1 is an exciting prospect, but really just an indicator for enhanced impact. Initiatives like our Rock Creek Ranch partnership and our dairy/cattle initiative present interesting research opportunities and meet needs for Idaho. We are on our way – this year, for the first time ever, we have crossed $100 million in research expenditures.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> We’re also going to deepen our engagement within Idaho. The <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/media-coverage/012216-idahoednews?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=100716&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=DirectAdmit&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" target=""_blank"">Direct Admit program</a> that offers automatic admission for qualified seniors will continue to make strides in changing our college-going culture. We’re going to renew our “Vandal Ideas Project,” an internal investment in UI creativity. Last year our focus was interdisciplinary scholarship and research. This year, the Vandal Ideas Project will tackle the “Engage” goal, working to help Idaho’s “go-on” effort. As the statewide higher education leader, we are well-positioned to apply our strengths to improve the Idaho we are proud to call home. &nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;<br /> We want to continue to transform lives at UI. That means increasing our enrollment, improving our retention, and ensuring our curricula evolve to best prepare our students for the dynamic and fast-changing world after graduation. We are making strides, with encouraging enrollment projections for our <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/admissions/first-year?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=100716&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=FirstYear&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" target=""_blank"">incoming freshmen</a> and <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/admissions/transfer?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=100716&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=Transfer&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" target=""_blank"">transfer students</a>, for underrepresented groups, and for residents of Idaho. Our Idaho resident enrollment has increased 7 percent this year; underrepresented groups by 14 percent. Progress will be gradual as we build on successive classes in the years ahead, but it has started.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> We also want to cultivate a valued and diverse community for students and for faculty and staff. We have some work to do in making our organization the best it can be for our employees. But we are tackling that issue head-on, and we will see progress. I want our institution to have a growth mindset, and as we turn the corner on enrollment, as we continue our excellence in research, teaching, and statewide engagement, we’ll connect better with our institutional excellence. We have the capability to solve any problem when we work together.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Last, this is an exciting time on campus. New facilities are expanding our capacity and capabilities. We’ve ushered in the new <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/here-we-have-idaho-magazine/education?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=100716&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=EducationBuilding&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16%20at%20&amp;ldquo;College%20of%20Education%20Building&amp;rdquo;%20in%20paragraph%206"" target=""_blank"">College of Education</a> building, a <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/here-we-have-idaho-magazine/library"" target=""_blank"">revamped Library</a>, and will open the <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/here-we-have-idaho-magazine/iric?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=100716&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=IRIC&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" target=""_blank"">Integrated Research and Innovation Center</a> soon.

And I appreciate that our alumni and friends support UI’s work and share the Vandal success story far and wide. That makes a difference. You make a difference. Thanks for a great year, and I look forward to our brave and bold future.

2016-10-14,These Great Rankings Tell Our Story,"<p></p> 
<p>Autumn means a season for changing leaves, football weekends and mid-term exams. It’s also a time when future college students closely examine their options for higher education. Students and families often rely on college guides and rankings to make college decisions. Rankings help guide a more nuanced approach to college selection than word-of-mouth or the impressions of friends, however well-meaning. But understanding the basis of rankings is important. Armed with that information, I hope that you will help friends understand the excellence of our premier research university.<br /> <br /> Every year we see an abundance of rankings and comparisons, each with a unique combination of metrics and weighting. Some rankings weight reputation or the quality of the incoming student body. I put a higher value on the student experience and on student outcomes, especially real-world career success after college.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> U.S. News and World Report is a widely-used, traditional ranking. The University of Idaho does well in this annual ranking – <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/bit.ly/KQvbKk']);"" href=""http://bit.ly/KQvbKk"" target=""_blank"">No. 171 among national universities</a> for 2017, with highly ranked programs in business and engineering. Worth noting, though, is that US News weights reputation (assessed by a survey of college administrators) and student selectivity highly. Student selectivity is essentially how many qualified students an institution turns away. I feel that education should be accessible for all qualified students; we have a mission to expand access, not restrict it. If lower student selectivity at UI dents an otherwise strong ranking, we accept that because we want to be measured on how many great students we bring in the door and graduate, not how many we lock out.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> This fall the federal government updated its <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/1.usa.gov/1QJBzQq']);"" href=""http://1.usa.gov/1QJBzQq"" target=""_blank"">College Scorecard </a>– not a ranking, per se, but a tool for learning more about institutions and comparing them. Clear-cut, authoritative and fact-based, it allows one to compare institutions based on measures such as average annual costs, six-year graduation rate, and financial success after college. The data are drawn from those students who received federal financial aid – more than half of our students and a very important population for us to serve. The College Scorecard gets to the heart of three critical factors every family needs to consider – cost to them, probability of their graduation, and what their career outcome will be. UI scores better than the national average in all categories, and best among all four-year public universities in Idaho.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> This summer UI was named one of <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/ti.me/2da8MLf']);"" href=""http://ti.me/2da8MLf"" target=""_blank"">Money magazine’s “Best Colleges”</a> and the <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/ti.me/29Jv9q8']);"" href=""http://ti.me/29Jv9q8"" target=""_blank"">best school in Idaho.</a>&nbsp;Quality of education, affordability and outcomes inform Money’s rankings. Some of their data come from the College Scorecard, and some come from <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/bit.ly/2dHV5Tw']);"" href=""http://bit.ly/2dHV5Tw"" target=""_blank"">PayScale</a>. This very practical ranking helps students answer key questions: Is the academic experience excellent? Can I afford it? Will it pay off with a good job? Our success on this ranking offers a resounding “Yes” to all three questions.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/bit.ly/2c91J1U']);"" href=""http://bit.ly/2c91J1U"" target=""_blank"">Washington Monthly</a> ranking takes a data-driven approach – no survey where administrators offer at-a-distance opinions on intangibles – and dials down on accessibility to families with financial need and service to first-generation students. Washington Monthly also assesses student success, innovative research and public service (we score especially high on service – this week we made our sixth consecutive appearance on the <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2016-october/101216-volunteerism?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=101416&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=Volunteerism&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" target=""_blank"">President’s Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll</a>, further proof of that commitment). UI is again one of America's top 100 national universities, No. 84, and clearly the highest-ranked university in Idaho. We're also a &quot;Best Bang for Your Buck&quot; college based on the return on investment a UI degree offers graduates.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Not all rankings are created equal. Nevertheless, as students look ahead to their own fall days at our great university, I hope they’ll take advantage of the many well-informed rankings that are out there to help guide their decision-making. Our rankings prove that the University of Idaho will serve them well, as we have for 127 years.</p> 
<span>Go Vandals!<br /> Chuck Staben<br /> President<br /> <br /> P.S. I want to congratulate our College of Law for its appearance on the cover of this month’s PreLaw magazine — we are the <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/bit.ly/2ebVQk1']);"" href=""http://bit.ly/2ebVQk1"" target=""_blank"">No. 8 Best Value Law School</a> in the nation. The program is helping students reduce debt and prepare for employment. For affordability and career success, our Law program exemplifies Vandal excellence, and I’m glad it’s getting noticed.</span>

2016-10-21,Announcing Our Plans for an Arena at UI&nbsp;,"<p></p> 
<p>For the two years of my presidency, my highest fundraising priority has been building a new arena for basketball and volleyball at the University of Idaho. Today I’m formally announcing the public phase of our campaign to <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/giving/athletics/idaho-arena?name=friday-letter&amp;utm_source=102116&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=IdahoArenaGiving&amp;utm_campaign=friday-letter16"" target=""_blank"">build an arena in Moscow</a>. This project is an investment in our student-athletes, a great student experience and an exciting campus environment for alumni, fans and the entire community. It is an investment in excellence.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Located on the field north of the ASUI-Kibbie Activity Center, the arena will be an outstanding place to build on our tradition of athletic success. Including a new practice court, office and conference space, the facility will alleviate the space constraints we face with basketball’s conflict with football in fall and with the Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival in spring. This adaptable, modern facility will help our basketball and volleyball programs compete for Big Sky Conference championships year in and year out. As Athletic Director Rob Spear puts it, “This will be one of the most impactful projects in the history of our athletic department. A new facility can transform and elevate our court sports to new heights.”&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The impact on recruiting will be tangible, too. The Cowan Spectrum has done a wonderful job for many years, but it’s time to build a facility that helps us consistently recruit outstanding student-athletes and maintain the Division I excellence we have every right to expect as Vandals. Our women’s basketball team has been to the NCAA tournament three of the past four seasons. Our men’s team just had their best season in 20 years. Let’s use that as a launching pad for the next generation of successful Vandal athletes.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> A new arena also enhances the student experience at UI. Students will be excited about heading to a game — or a concert, conference or lecture — in a space that is designed for those experiences. I’m thrilled that our student government at ASUI backs this plan. The facilities fee they originated and passed is the seed funding that will allow this idea to grow. We’ll see opportunities for faculty and hands-on student involvement in all phases of this project — from our art and architecture Design Lab, to our natural resources programs, to civil engineering. Upon completion, students in movement sciences, journalism, marketing and more will find the facility a practical place to exercise their emerging talents and skills.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> This is a building that represents Idaho, and, accordingly, we’ve been working with Idaho’s forest products industry. Wood is a central design element in the building’s 4,700-seat, 70,000-square-foot design. As Idaho’s land-grant research leader, we plan to demonstrate what it means to build a cutting-edge facility with our state’s abundant renewable resource.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> In total, we have over half of the project cost committed. Student support has been pivotal. I want to thank the Associated Students of the University of Idaho (ASUI) for recognizing the need for this project and stepping up with fee support that can be used to bond up to $5 million of the arena cost. We have other commitments from generous friends of the university. Our next steps are to ask for the <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/www.sites.uidaho.edu/giving/givingform.aspx?presets=RF176&amp;giftid=RF176']);"" href=""https://www.sites.uidaho.edu/giving/givingform.aspx?presets=RF176&amp;giftid=RF176"" target=""_blank"">support of all our alumni and friends</a>. While completing our fundraising, we plan to ask the State Board of Education for approval to plan and bid the construction in February 2017. I know that ASUI President Cruz Botello and others share my hope that entering freshmen in fall 2017 will cheer on the Vandals in the arena during their senior year.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;<br /> This is a game-changing project for our campus, for our athletics program and for Idaho. Together, let’s <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/www.sites.uidaho.edu/giving/givingform.aspx?presets=RF176&amp;giftid=RF176']);"" href=""https://www.sites.uidaho.edu/giving/givingform.aspx?presets=RF176&amp;giftid=RF176"" target=""_blank"">build something special</a> at the University of Idaho.</p>

2016-10-28,Our Enrollment Growth at UI,"<p></p> 
<p>This is an exciting time at the University of Idaho. Last week we announced the public campaign for a <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/giving/athletics/idaho-arena?utm_source=University+of+Idaho&amp;utm_campaign=44791a405f-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2016_10_27&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_18a9cb4835-44791a405f-"">new arena for basketball and volleyball</a>. The arena will enrich UI’s great residential experience and offer outstanding facilities to our student-athletes in all court sports. Our students want this facility, and have stepped forward to support it. Consider investing in this game-changing facility yourself.</p> 
<p class=""p1"">We’ve also made <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2016-october/101916-enrollment2016?utm_source=University+of+Idaho&amp;utm_campaign=44791a405f-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2016_10_27&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_18a9cb4835-44791a405f-"">enrollment gains</a>&nbsp;— an important trend for UI and our state. Overall, our enrollment increased 3.6 percent, to 11,780. We realized a 6.5 percent increase in new Idaho resident freshman, amid a 4.5 increase in overall new freshmen. For in-state students, the Direct Admissions program, spurred by UI in partnership with our State Board of Education, is part of that success story. Direct Admissions offered automatic admission to qualified high school seniors and resulted in a 5 percent system-wide increase, according to 10th-day state board enrollment data, in addition to the gains at UI.&nbsp;</p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>One Direct Admissions anecdote needs to be shared, from a new freshman from Boise whose high school career had been “up and down.” The Direct Admissions letter he received informing him that he was admitted to the University of Idaho was the first time he’d imagined our university was a possibility. He hadn’t thought he could get accepted. He’s now a freshman on campus in one of our fraternities, enthusiastic about his classes and taking every advantage of an opportunity he didn’t even know he’d earned. I know there are many students like him, including many first-generation college attendees who make up nearly one-third of our student body this fall.</span></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>We’ve also seen an increase in new transfer students, both from Idaho and beyond, 8.6 and 4.9 percent, respectively. Those Idaho students benefit from <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/admissions/apply/transfer/vandalink?utm_source=University+of+Idaho&amp;utm_campaign=44791a405f-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2016_10_27&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_18a9cb4835-44791a405f-"">VandaLink agreements</a> with North Idaho College, the College of Western Idaho, the College of Southern Idaho and Eastern Idaho Technical College. VandaLink provides a seamless transfer of credits and scholarship support for the many community college students who are ready to take on a four-year degree.</span></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>We are a diverse, inclusive and global campus. The percentage of students from underrepresented groups in our freshman class rose from 16 percent to 23.2 percent. That increase grows out of strong work by our diversity advisory groups, our admissions and recruiting teams, and special programs such as our <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/diversity/dhr/native-american-student-center/scholarships/tribal-excellence?utm_source=University+of+Idaho&amp;utm_campaign=44791a405f-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2016_10_27&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_18a9cb4835-44791a405f-"">Tribal Excellence Scholarship</a>. This fall students come to UI from all 50 states and Washington, D.C., 79 countries, and the U.S. territories of American Samoa and the Virgin Islands.</span></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>I want to keep building on our success. We’re continuing to lead the charge in the Direct Admissions initiative. High school students across Idaho — maybe one you know, maybe your own child — may have already received notification of automatic admission to the University of Idaho, based on their academic qualifications. I encourage those students — and I hope you will, too — to take the next steps, save their spots at UI, and get started with financial aid at <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/admissions/apply?utm_source=University+of+Idaho&amp;utm_campaign=44791a405f-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2016_10_27&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_18a9cb4835-44791a405f-"">uidaho.edu/apply</a>. Federal changes mean you can fill out FAFSA right now, using last year’s taxes. UI has moved its <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/financial-aid/scholarships?utm_source=University+of+Idaho&amp;utm_campaign=44791a405f-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2016_10_27&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_18a9cb4835-44791a405f-"">financial aid priority date</a> to Dec. 1 so that students and families will know their financial aid awards by the holidays – more time to make the best decision for a great education. And as of this fall, we have waived the application fee for Idaho residents. We will forego about $200,000 in revenue — an investment we are making in the future of Idaho students.</span></p>

2016-11-03,Our Native American Partnerships,"<p></p> 
<p class=""p1"">The University of Idaho is dedicated to serving all people. Our student body is more diverse than ever. This year's increase in enrollment includes more students who identify as Native American, reflecting on our strong partnership with regional tribes.</p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>This fall saw a 9.8 percent increase in Native American students at UI. Contributing factors to that growth include our <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/diversity/dhr/native-american-student-center/scholarships/tribal-excellence?utm_source=University+of+Idaho&amp;utm_campaign=5325aba725-Friday+Letter_2016_11_04&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_18a9cb4835-5325aba725-"">Tribal Excellence Scholarship</a>, which extends the equivalent of in-state tuition to members of the 10 tribes with which UI has a memorandum of understanding (MOU) and to tribal college transfer students. That program emerged through consultation with our MOU tribes, who have representatives on campus this week for annual meetings.

I have no doubt he will go far.<br /> <br /> Tonight we’ll celebrate this decade of commitment at our annual UI Veterans Appreciation Dinner. We are honored to be joined by Aaron and Bonnie Contreras, two of the first Operation Education scholars. Aaron, our guest speaker, graduated from UI’s College of Law in 2010 and is an active duty Army Judge Advocate General (JAG) captain.

2016-11-18,From Idaho to the U.S. Capitol,"<p></p> 
<p>This holiday season, Idaho residents can share the pride of knowing the tree shining at the U.S. Capitol glows with a little extra silver and gold flair, cut from the heart of our beautiful state.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Known as “the People’s Tree,” this stately evergreen is telling the story of Idaho — and of us as the state’s land-grant university. This designation gives UI a distinct mission to provide access to higher education across our state, to conduct innovative research and to engage our statewide community.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> This year's tree hails from the Payette National Forest near our McCall Field Campus. For more than 75 years, the McCall Field Campus has been a critical part of our effort to bring more students to college. UI’s&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/cnr/moss"" target=""_blank"">McCall Outdoor Science School</a>&nbsp;has delivered hands-on learning opportunities to more than 20,000 K-12 students from across Idaho. More than 1,000 teachers have participated in professional training that equips them to prepare our next generation.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The U.S. Capitol Christmas Tree represents our historic role in research connected to natural resources, especially through our&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/cnr"" target=""_blank"">College of Natural Resources</a>. Our ready access to facilities, forests and wilderness areas provide students unmatched opportunities to work in the field. Among those resources is the 10,000-acre&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/cnr/uief"" target=""_blank"">UI Experimental Forest</a>, just 20 minutes from our Moscow campus. The&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/cnr/taylor"" target=""_blank"">Taylor Wilderness Research Station</a>&nbsp;in the heart of the Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness is a home like no other for faculty and student research — 70 percent of UI natural resources students get involved in research. These assets and experiences have helped make the College of Natural Resources a top 10 natural resource college, according to USA Today.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The U.S. Capitol Christmas Tree&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2016-november/110716-capitolchristmastree"" target=""_blank"">stopped at the University of Idaho in Moscow last week</a>&nbsp;on its way across the country to Washington, D.C., and many UI students and employees added their holiday greetings to the truck. You can view photos of its visit to Moscow&nbsp;<a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/www.facebook.com/uidahopresident']);"" href=""https://www.facebook.com/uidahopresident"" target=""_blank"">on my Facebook page</a>.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> As the tree continues its national tour, it symbolizes many things — the beauty of our state, the traditions of family and community, and a sense of national unity. We can be proud that this symbol of Christmas spirit came from Idaho, and proud of the role that the University of Idaho plays in studying, protecting and preserving our beautiful forests.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The tree symbolizes a promise of a bright future for our state, our nation and our institution. I am glad that our state, our Idaho, can help share that story.<br /> <br /> Go Vandals!<br /> Chuck Staben</p>

2016-12-02,A Year of Progress at UI,"<p></p> 
<p class=""p1"">This has been an exciting year at the University of Idaho. Across our statewide campus, new programs, initiatives and facilities are making an impact. The hard work of our faculty and staff has been complemented by the commitment of our students, alumni and friends. Our <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/president/communications/annual-report?utm_source=University+of+Idaho&amp;utm_campaign=d44000395e-Friday+Letter_2016-12-02&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_18a9cb4835-d44000395e-"">2016 Annual Report</a>, released this week, captures some of those successes and lays the groundwork for future excellence.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The annual report is used to assess our progress and adjust efforts in the next year. It sets a baseline for gauging our impact in key areas — research and scholarship, teaching and learning, and outreach and engagement. In coming years, expect to see annual progress on our <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/provost/strategic-plan?utm_source=University+of+Idaho&amp;utm_campaign=d44000395e-Friday+Letter_2016-12-02&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_18a9cb4835-d44000395e-"">strategic plan goals</a> documented here.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The annual report offers a chance for reflection and assessment. Where are we doing well? Where could we be stronger? Readers will also find a focus on the intangibles that make us who we are: our mission and vision, as well as our institutional principles and values of excellence, respect, integrity, perseverance and sustainability. These are concepts that unite us; they are not just words, but deeply held commitments to beliefs and practices.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The report also highlights the tangible excellence we achieved in the past year. We grew our enrollment, including bringing more Idaho students into higher education through the <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/admissions/direct-admissions?utm_source=University+of+Idaho&amp;utm_campaign=d44000395e-Friday+Letter_2016-12-02&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_18a9cb4835-d44000395e-"">Direct Admissions</a> initiative. We completed a total renovation of our <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/ed/about/building?utm_source=University+of+Idaho&amp;utm_campaign=d44000395e-Friday+Letter_2016-12-02&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_18a9cb4835-d44000395e-"">College of Education building</a> and a remodel of our Wallace Residence Center.

And we set our sights on a market-based compensation system as part of our dedication to fostering an outstanding work environment. These are but a few examples — see the full report for more.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> I have intentionally used the first person plural in discussing these successes. Individual efforts are important, but these accomplishments are not something any one of us does alone. We come together as a university community — and that includes our alumni and supporters — to build a better UI for our students and our state. We all have valuable roles to play.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> That collaboration has our institution moving forward. We have made great progress this year, and we have outstanding success to build on in the years ahead. I say it often because it’s true: We are a brave and bold institution. So in the words of our fight song, let’s “all bear down for Idaho.”<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Go mighty Vandals!<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Chuck Staben<br /> President<br /> &nbsp;<br /> P.S. With a 7-4 record with one game left in the season, our Vandal football team is bowl eligible! We will have information to share soon about which bowl game we will be playing in. Congratulations to the Vandal football student-athletes, coaches and staff. The football team’s motto, “Expect to Win,” aptly describes the brave and bold way Vandals have approached this season on and off the field. It’s also a great attitude to apply to endeavors across UI life and work.

We celebrate their accomplishments, their hard work, their persistence and their creativity. Our Vandals have spent long days, nights, weeks and years getting to the Kibbie Dome this Saturday. They are prepared for the great career and satisfying life that come with a University of Idaho degree.</p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>Graduation is one of the pivotal moments we have in life. It’s a chance to reflect on who you are and who you will be.</span></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>During the holiday season, one timeless tale that touches on those themes of personal growth and reflection is Charles Dickens’ “A Christmas Carol.” This December, our Theatre Arts Department in the College of Letters, Arts and Social Sciences is staging its<a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/class/theatre/productions-and-events/christmas-carol?utm_source=University+of+Idaho&amp;utm_campaign=7c8933e683-Friday+Letter_2016_12_09&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_18a9cb4835-7c8933e683-""> fourth consecutive and final production of this Christmas classic</a>, which offers universal lessons, transcending any particular faith or creed. I will draw on lessons from the story to share with our graduates tomorrow.</span></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>The story is familiar to many — Mary Beth and I enjoyed it with our children countless times. Ebenezer Scrooge is a wealthy but miserly man who receives visitations from a series of ghosts — specters from the past, present and future. The first shows him the love and warmth he forsook for greed. The second shows him the joy others experience in the holiday season, even amid the hardship faced by the Cratchit family. The last shows Scrooge a world where his death is not mourned, in contrast with the untimely passing of Tiny Tim.&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>It is a haunting vision, and Scrooge emerges a changed man. He’s received an opportunity that only occurs in novels and movies, unfortunately — the chance to see your future made real and change it before it comes to pass. That’s the important lesson I want our graduates to take away: retain the capacity to change, both personally and to impact the world around you.&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>Our graduates have the chance to be the person they want to be — thinkers, doers, leaders, friends and helpers. People who are both ambitious and generous. Beyond their own success, I’ll ask them to think about the impact they want to see around them. What challenges need their skills? What injustice requires their attention? What broader opportunity can come to life with their diligence? Vandals are leaders and successful in all walks of life — they are uniquely positioned to make the world around them a better place. In the words of “A Christmas Carol” co-directors David Lee-Painter and Daniel Haley, “Be the blessing.” One can think of that as “Be that future” — embody the future you want to see, and work to create it.</span></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>Those are chapters that our graduates start to write this Saturday. They are prepared with an outstanding education, with a network of friends and mentors, and with a <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/alumni?utm_source=University+of+Idaho&amp;utm_campaign=7c8933e683-Friday+Letter_2016_12_09&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_18a9cb4835-7c8933e683-"">Vandal alumni family</a> whose passion is unmatched.<br /> <br /> Go Vandals!<br /> <br /> Chuck Staben<br /> President</span><br /> <br /> </p>

And many times alumni choose to invest in our students — students like Olivia Dowling.&nbsp;</p> 
<p class=""p1"">Olivia Dowling ‘16, embodies the energy, curiosity, and determination of University of Idaho students. In high school Olivia had a passion for forging relationships with everyone around her, and she has always been drawn to good advertising with a powerful message.</p> 
<p class=""p1"">Olivia combined her love of people with her passion for persuasive communication by choosing to study advertising, one of the many degrees offered in The University of Idaho School of Journalism and Mass Media (JAMM).</p> 
<p class=""p1"">Olivia is a first generation college student from Alaska and going to school so far away from home created many challenges, but UI instantly felt like home and she has loved her time here. Her JAMM professors inspire her to succeed by requiring excellence in all things.</p>

2017-01-06,Four Great Accomplishments from 2016,"<p></p> 
<p>Welcome to an exciting new year at the University of Idaho. We have no shortage of work to do in the year ahead. But I want to reflect on the progress we made in 2016, accomplishments that provide forward momentum for our university. Here are four key areas where UI is excelling:</p> 
<ol> 
 <li> <p><em>Increasing enrollment.</em> Fall 2016 brought to UI the <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2016-october/101916-enrollment2016"" target=""_blank"">first overall enrollment increase</a> since 2012. Our <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/admissions/direct-admissions"" target=""_blank"">Direct Admissions</a> initiative in partnership with the state has opened the door to more Idaho students (a 6.5 percent increase in Idaho freshmen), including many who are among the first generation in their families to go to college. We know that for most people higher education is the best pathway for good jobs and great lives, so it’s essential that we keep building on this success. In 2016 we <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/bit.ly/2iIYwcr']);"" href=""http://bit.ly/2iIYwcr"" target=""_blank"">eliminated our application fee for Idaho residents</a>, and continue to offer the most scholarship support in our state. Growth is good for students, good for Idaho and good for UI.<br /> <br /> </p> </li> 
 <li> <p><em>Expanding innovation.</em> In 2016, UI topped $100 million in research expenditures. We are far and away <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/research"" target=""_blank"">Idaho’s research leader</a> — that $100 million is more than double the research of all other Idaho institutions combined. That research, scholarship and creative activity makes a difference for our state in fields such as agriculture, engineering, clean energy, arts and culture, and more. One example of that always evolving impact can be found in our new partnership at <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/cnr/rangeland-center/projects/rock-creek"" target=""_blank"">Rock Creek Ranch</a>, launched in summer 2016, which will study how to manage our rangeland at the intersection of grazing and conservation.<br /> <br /> </p> </li> 
 <li> <p><em>Leading the way in transformative excellence.</em> Our university stands out for success in and out of the classroom. From our acclaimed <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/academic-affairs/university-honors-program"" target=""_blank"">University Honors Program</a>, to our <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2016-october/101216-volunteerism"" target=""_blank"">nationally recognized student servic</a><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2016-october/101216-volunteerism"" target=""_blank"">e</a>, to our Northwest-leading cadre of National Merit Scholars, our students set a high bar for excellence on their way to the <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/bit.ly/2dHV5Tw']);"" href=""http://bit.ly/2dHV5Tw"" target=""_blank"">best career outcomes of any Idaho institution</a>. Our students took advantage of unique experiences available on our residential campus, whether participating in one of 200 student organizations or in unique UI opportunities such as our <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/cnr/wild"" target=""_blank"">Semester in the Wild</a> program or our <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/campus-recreation/outdoor-program"" target=""_blank"">acclaimed Outdoor Program</a>. Our athletics program capped a season of championships in women’s basketball, women’s soccer, women’s tennis, and men’s and women’s golf with a resounding football victory in the <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/events/special-interest-events/athletics/bowl-game"" target=""_blank"">Famous Idaho Potato Bowl in Boise</a>.<br /> <br /> </p> </li> 
 <li> <p><em>Serving our state.</em> We are the University of <em>Idaho</em>, and we are committed to serving the entire state as its land-grant institution. Our mission sees us producing Idaho’s leaders in many fields — in <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/academics/wwami"" target=""_blank"">medicine</a>, in <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/law"" target=""_blank"">law</a>, in public service and more. <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/cals/idaho-agricultural-experiment-station"" target=""_blank"">Facilities across Idaho</a> anchor our partnership with communities and industry. Whether in farm fields, on the range, in 4-H groups, or in local classrooms and community centers, the University of Idaho remains a vital part of the fabric of Idaho. &nbsp;</p> </li> 
</ol> 
<p> Clearly, we are well-positioned for continued success. I thank our statewide faculty and staff for their hard work, innovation and commitment. Importantly, our <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/alumni"" target=""_blank"">alumni and friends</a> champion our university and support its mission with time, enthusiasm and philanthropy. Thank you contributing to our shared success.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> If you haven’t seen it already, please enjoy the video below that highlights a great 2016. I look forward to working with you on the challenges and opportunities 2017 brings.<br /> <br /> Go Vandals!<br /> <em>Chuck Staben<br /> President</em></p>

2017-01-13,The Task for Idaho Higher Education,"<p></p> 
<p class=""p1"">Last week, Gov. Otter announced the <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/bit.ly/2jcMKJB?utm_source=University+of+Idaho&amp;utm_campaign=99ec9c2490-Friday+Letter_2017_01_13&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_18a9cb4835-99ec9c2490-']);"" href=""http://bit.ly/2jcMKJB?utm_source=University+of+Idaho&amp;utm_campaign=99ec9c2490-Friday+Letter_2017_01_13&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_18a9cb4835-99ec9c2490-"" target=""_blank"">formation of a Higher Education Task Force</a> to develop a five-year plan for higher education in Idaho, building on the work of the K-12 task force, whose 2013 recommendations are in the third year of implementation. The Higher Education Task Force has the same potential to influence policymaking. The 28-member committee will be comprised of higher education administrators, business and community leaders, and students. I look forward to studying the issues and working with my fellow task force members to develop recommendations that strengthen higher education in Idaho.</p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>My responsibility on the committee is to take a balanced view of systemwide needs, but also to advance an understanding of how our land-grant, national research university adds to the higher education landscape in Idaho. In other words, how can our state’s system be improved, and how can Idaho invest so that higher education contributes even greater value? I’m interested to assess how we can better use UI’s strengths: making higher education accessible to Idaho citizens, conducting innovative research that unlocks new knowledge and spurs economic development, and engaging with the communities we serve.</span></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>My presidency has focused in large part on bringing more Idahoans into higher education. The state’s <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/bit.ly/1pGs1aq?utm_source=University+of+Idaho&amp;utm_campaign=99ec9c2490-Friday+Letter_2017_01_13&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_18a9cb4835-99ec9c2490-']);"" href=""http://bit.ly/1pGs1aq?utm_source=University+of+Idaho&amp;utm_campaign=99ec9c2490-Friday+Letter_2017_01_13&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_18a9cb4835-99ec9c2490-"" target=""_blank"">60 percent goal for postsecondary completion</a> is an important marker, and we will need new ideas and new investments to achieve that goal. Enhancing Idaho’s college-going culture was the motivation for the Direct Admissions program — a program that benefits not just UI but all Idaho higher education institutions — and for our many other efforts to expand college access and retain affordability. We know that higher education is increasingly essential for individual success. <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/bit.ly/2bor8GP?utm_source=University+of+Idaho&amp;utm_campaign=99ec9c2490-Friday+Letter_2017_01_13&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_18a9cb4835-99ec9c2490-']);"" href=""http://bit.ly/2bor8GP?utm_source=University+of+Idaho&amp;utm_campaign=99ec9c2490-Friday+Letter_2017_01_13&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_18a9cb4835-99ec9c2490-"" target=""_blank"">More than 95 percent (11.5 million) of new jobs</a> created since the Great Recession have gone to people with at least some postsecondary education. Want a great job? Want a great life? Now more than ever, it starts with going to college.</span></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>Public investment in affordable postsecondary education is critical if we want to help students get to college and succeed there. I want to make sure our investment in higher education — an investment that already delivers returns many times over — is aligned in the most effective and efficient way possible to meet the demands of our students and our state in a fast-changing economy. We have partnerships with the K-12 system, with fellow higher education institutions, and with businesses and communities that can all be enhanced to deliver even greater returns.</span></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>I share Gov. Otter’s confidence in the task force members, led by Linda Clark, State Board of Education member, and Bob Lokken, the CEO of White Cloud Analytics and president of Idaho Business for Education. I look forward to hearing from my fellow task force members, and to exploring how the state can ensure that UI and all our partners can do more to help Idaho continue to grow and thrive.<br /> <br /> Go Vandals!<br /> <em>Chuck Staben<br /> President</em></span></p>

2017-01-20,Changing 'The Way It Is',"<p></p> 
<p class=""p1"">On Monday, we celebrated Martin Luther King Jr.-Idaho Human Rights Day. It’s a chance to honor the progress of civil rights in our country and our state, to continue to that work through local service, and to reflect on the future we want to see in the world.</p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>Let me share one story. When I taught at the University of Kentucky, the university encouraged faculty members to honor Dr. King in some way, but we did not have the day off — classes were held. For several years, as a relatively new teacher, I didn’t know how to honor the day. Mostly, I could not think how Dr. King was relevant to the microbiology or genetics I was teaching.&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>In 1994, Mary Beth and I purchased a home that had been part of a development in 1948. The deed had a restriction that was common in 1948, but that anyone today would recognize as illegal and immoral. The deed said that we could not sell or rent our property “to any Negro or mulatto,” in the language of that time, nor to any “association” of the same. Furthermore, an African-American could reside on the property, but only in the capacity of a domestic servant.</span></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>I was so struck by this deed that for years, each Martin Luther King Jr. Day, I projected it for the 150 students in my genetics class and asked them what they thought. Undergraduates are often shy about responding to any question, but eventually a student would volunteer that it was illegal, and that it was wrong. Sometimes they would use even stronger language.</span></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>I agreed, of course, and pointed out that this clause was common in 1948, found even up until 1960 in Lexington. In part because of the heroic actions of people like Dr. King, we now recognized how wrong such discrimination is. I would then ask the class to cast themselves back 40 years, though, back to when their grandparents might have been students in the class. What would they have thought? That’s a tougher question. Some would have been upset. But many people in 1955 would have thought this was a routine fact of life, not an injustice — “just the way it is.”</span></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>So I asked my students, and it remains worth considering: 40 years from today, what will your grandchildren marvel at that we didn’t see in the same way?</span></p> 
<p class=""p1""><span>Today, we undoubtedly still have blind spots. I am proud, though, of how <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/diversity?utm_source=University+of+Idaho&amp;utm_campaign=57d7283020-Friday+Letter_2017_01_20&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_18a9cb4835-57d7283020-"">our students, staff and leadership</a> come together with <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/diversity/dhr/oma/events/mlk-day?utm_source=University+of+Idaho&amp;utm_campaign=57d7283020-Friday+Letter_2017_01_20&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_18a9cb4835-57d7283020-"">meaningful programming</a> — seminars, food drives, community events and more — around this special day. That spirit of service and struggle builds on a wonderful legacy, helping ensure that in the years to come we will live in a better world, and look back with pride on progress.</span></p>

2017-01-27,A Special Week in Boise,"<p></p> 
<p>This week Vandals converged on our state Capitol for “Higher Education Week.” It’s a time for sharing the University of Idaho story with our Legislature, meeting future Vandals at our annual downtown Boise recruiting event, and recognizing our great alumni at the Ada County Silver and Gold Awards celebration.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> I was proud to <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/bit.ly/2kuGTRx ']);"" href=""http://bit.ly/2kuGTRx%20"" target=""_blank"">explain UI’s progress</a> with members of the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee and the Senate and House education committees. I reminded them that the University of Idaho continues to be an outstanding investment, a public higher education experience that brings return on investment many times over in the lives of students, in research that propels our economy and in engagement that touches every community in Idaho. We have made great progress in enrolling more students and in conducting research of unmatched quality and scale in our state.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> For the coming year, our priorities gained the support of Gov. Otter, which I shared with the Legislature. State investment in adult completion scholarships will encourage nontraditional students to re-enroll. A change in employee compensation will allow us to recruit and retain talented Vandals. The governor supports the exciting <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/research/entities/cafe"" target=""_blank"">Center for Agriculture, Food and the Environment</a> project near Twin Falls. We’re also focusing on building a fourth-year to the program that allows students to complete an <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/engr/degrees-and-programs/cda"" target=""_blank"">undergraduate computer science degree in Coeur d’Alene</a>, and on investing in our <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/cals/research-and-extension"" target=""_blank"">Agricultural Research and Extension Service</a> and other special programs.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> This week was also a chance to watch the full circle of the Vandal experience, from new student to proud alumni. Wednesday night we had a well-attended <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/events/meet-the-vandals/about"" target=""_blank"">“Meet the Vandals”</a> recruiting event. I enjoyed meeting the many young women and men looking to make a decision about where to attend college. They heard from me and our great recruiting team about why UI is the best choice for higher education. I look forward to seeing them on campus next fall.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Thursday night we celebrated at our <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2017-january/012317-silverandgold?utm_source=University+of+Idaho&amp;utm_campaign=cf5c5dcc27-Friday_Letter_2017_01_27&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_18a9cb4835-cf5c5dcc27-"">Ada County Silver and Gold dinner</a>. Two great Vandals were honored: Doug Gross, winner of the Silver and Gold Award, and Howard Foley, our Jim Lyle Award winner. Each exemplifies Vandal success in professional life, and in their commitment to the University of Idaho. I am proud to consider Doug and Howard personal friends, and it was an honor to present them their well-deserved awards.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Seeing the silver and gold around Boise during “Higher Education Week” is always special. Thank you to the Vandals new and not-so-new who helped make it a meaningful week.</p>

2017-02-03,Making Things Happen with Our New Research Facility,"<p></p> 
<p>Dear Friends,</p> 
<p>This week, research and scholarship at UI took a leap forward with the <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/research/entities/iric"" title=""Integrated Research and Innovation Center"">opening of the Integrated Research and Innovation Center (IRIC)</a>. Idaho’s research leader now has a world-class center for interdisciplinary research and discovery in the heart of our Moscow campus. IRIC gives us the ability to take on key research questions in new ways, and it sends a signal about who we are and who we will become. </p> 
<p>IRIC offers cutting-edge space for our outstanding faculty researchers and for undergraduate and graduate students who are gaining hands-on experience. The building is designed to be adaptable for the teams who will rotate in and out, with specialized equipment and flexible laboratory set-ups. This facility embraces the full spectrum of research and scholarship at UI, not just in science, technology and engineering, but also in the social sciences, humanities, and arts. In the words of Vice President for Research and Economic Development Janet Nelson, “Each space is defined by the imagination of the researchers in it.”</p> 
<p>When I began as president, the space where IRIC now stands was an empty field, but the groundwork had been laid for the facility. We were joined for the Tuesday ribbon-cutting by many people who helped make the building a reality, including <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/www.facebook.com/uidahopresident/photos/pcb.1294569843933069/1294567937266593/?type=1&amp;theater']);"" href=""https://www.facebook.com/uidahopresident/photos/pcb.1294569843933069/1294567937266593/?type=1&amp;theater"" target=""_blank"">Dayaldas Meshri, Ph.D.</a>, a graduate in chemistry and supporter of the building. Meshri studied under professor Jean’ne Shreeve and with professor Malcom Renfrew. He continues a tradition of excellence as a chemist, business leader and philanthropist, and he’s remained a closely connected member of the Vandal family for many years.</p> 
<p>More than 20 teams were accepted to move into IRIC, and research projects have already begun. Ribbon-cutting attendees had a chance to tour the building and see those projects in action, including a new home for research on the potato cyst nematode, ways to prepare communities for wildfire, archaeological studies of Idaho history and culture, health care policy analysis, brain and spinal cord modeling, and much more.</p> 
<p>We have a new growth mindset at the University of Idaho. Our destiny is under our control. We are going to continue to expand our leading research position in the state and beyond. As University Distinguished Professor and the leader of the IRIC-based Center for Modeling Complex Interactions Holly Wichman said during the ceremony, <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/www.facebook.com/uidahopresident/photos/pcb.1294569843933069/1294568240599896/?type=3&amp;theater']);"" href=""https://www.facebook.com/uidahopresident/photos/pcb.1294569843933069/1294568240599896/?type=3&amp;theater"" target=""_blank"">“Let’s make things happen.”</a></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Every faculty member and student, whether their lab happens to be in IRIC or not, should look at this building as in investment in our very bright future.</p> 
<p>Go Vandals!</p> 
<p>Chuck Staben<br /> President</p>

In March, Mary Beth will join Noel Schultz, professor of electrical engineering and first lady at neighboring Washington State University, and a number of other academic women leaders, for a panel presentation at our biennial <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/diversity/dhr/womens-center/events/womens-leadership-conference"" target=""_blank"">Women’s Leadership Conference</a>. This year’s theme is “Leaned On While Leaning In: Valuing Women’s Invisible Labor.” Organized in partnership with WSU and Lewis-Clark State College, the conference is one of many valuable resources UI has on our campus and as part of statewide and national efforts to promote women’s leadership in the academy and beyond.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/diversity/dhr/womens-center"" target=""_blank"">Women’s Center</a> on campus in Moscow is one of the longest-running, continuously operated campus-based women’s centers in the country. It offers a strong base of support and advocacy for women students, staff and faculty. Director Lysa Salsbury guides the Women’s Center in leading campus education and outreach on women’s and gender issues, serving as a valuable resource for interdisciplinary engagement and activism, and connecting with the community. The center’s annual production of <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/diversity/dhr/womens-center/events/vagina-monologues"" target=""_blank"">“The Vagina Monologues”</a> opens today, Feb. 10, and raises critical funding for <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/bit.ly/2kTWMkl']);"" href=""http://bit.ly/2kTWMkl"" target=""_blank"">Alternatives to Violence of the Palouse</a>.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/diversity/dhr/womens-center/athena"" target=""_blank"">Athena</a> is another important internal resource at UI, as our professional association for women, with membership open to all employees. The organization facilitates mentoring, networking, engagement and leadership. A variety of activities include monthly socials, brown bag programs and Women of the Year awards. Athena, led by co-presidents Erin Chapman and Lisa Salsbury, also helps with the Women’s Leadership Conference and partners with the American Council on Education (ACE) to facilitate other professional opportunities for UI women.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> I have recently been proud to join ACE on the <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/bit.ly/2kY4t8z']);"" href=""http://bit.ly/2kY4t8z"" target=""_blank"">“Moving the Needle: Advancing Women in Higher Education Leadership”</a> campaign. The project aims at increasing representation of women in higher education senior leadership. ACE also is building a statewide collaboration with Idaho higher education institutions. I congratulate and thank professor Vanessa Sielert, in our Lionel Hampton School of Music and College of Letters, Arts and Social Sciences, for her leadership in re-energizing this valuable network.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Professional opportunity is a pipeline. At the University of Idaho, I want to ensure that we are seeing our people through all parts of the pipeline, especially as they move toward senior leadership. For faculty and staff members looking for more development opportunities, I encourage them to get involved at the upcoming Women’s Leadership Conference. Our working, learning and living environments are all better served when the work of all our Vandal family members is visible, and when all contributions are valued. </td>

</xml><![endif]-->Earl and Carol Bennett committed $25,000 to fund a new endowment that supports strategic initiatives in the College of Science. “Carol and I established the endowment simply as 'payback' for a great education and for helping us become who we are,” Earl says. “We are also concerned about the low percentage of Idaho kids going to college and want to help increase these numbers.” Both Vandals, Earl ’74 earned his doctorate in geology, and Carol ‘72 ’74 ’76 ’94 earned her bachelor’s and master’s in both family and consumer sciences and education. Carol recently retired as coordinator of student services at Walla Walla Community College’s Clarkston campus. Earl is dean emeritus of the College of Science and served as state geologist of Idaho prior to his retirement.

Cohen Sound Achievement Award</a>. The award is part of the U.S. Institute of Theatre Technology’s (USITT) prestigious Awards for Young Designers and Technicians in the Performing Arts. The award recognizes Wright-Ogren for her excellence and creative application of sound in the performing arts. While pursuing her master of fine arts in the College of Letters, Arts and Social Sciences, she has been active in the USITT student chapter and has designed sound for several productions including UI’s productions of “Medea: Her Story” and “The Little Prince,” as well as the Lewiston Civic Theatre’s “The Night of the Iguana.” “Keely’s a natural talent,” said Ann Hoste, chair of UI Theatre Arts. “She weaves together individual ‘sounds’ to create these seamless soundscapes that are deeply evocative but never intrusive. She’s also an incredibly generous artist, always willing to share her expertise with others.” </td>

The team includes assistant professor Crystal Kolden and associate professor Alistair Smith in the UI College of Natural Resources <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/cnr/departments/forest-rangeland-and-fire-sciences"" target=""_blank"">Department of Forest, Rangeland and Fire Sciences</a>; John Abatzoglou, an associate professor in the UI College of Science <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/sci/geography"" target=""_blank"">Department of Geography</a>; and researchers from the University of Tasmania in Australia and South Dakota State University. The research team analyzed 23 million wildfire events around the globe that occurred from 2002-2013. From this database, they focused on the top 478 most intense fire events. Of these, the team found that approximately 30 percent were disastrous fires for humans. The study concludes that there is an urgent need for communities to become more resilient in the face of wildfire. Some of this work will require a cultural shift in the way people think about investing in fire preparedness.<br /> &nbsp; </td>

Reeves, a retired Lieutenant Colonel in the U.S. Army, is the recipient of the Outstanding Public Service Award, our nation's highest award for volunteerism. His appearance is part of a robust series of Black History Month events at UI, and a reminder that our shared national history is often made up of individual and local stories of action and inspiration.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> I met Reginald two years ago in Idaho Falls, and was struck by his story. A 1952 graduate, he came to Idaho from the pre-Civil Rights-era South, having seen historical photos of our diverse classes at UI. Mr. Reeves practiced law for many years in Idaho Falls and volunteers with local soup kitchens, homeless shelters and charities, even starting a prescription-assistance program for geographically isolated veterans. His admittance to the law program and success, at a time when African-Americans were often denied those opportunities, is part of a larger story of advancements toward integration and diversity at UI and in higher education.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Most Americans are familiar with the broader strokes of African-American history, and the roles of leading figures like Martin Luther King Jr., Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass. But Black History Month helps us hear an often under-reported history, engage in a dialogue with each other, and find new understandings. We see how history is shaped by individual people, their battles connected to a broader fight.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> In addition to the presentation by Mr. Reeves, our <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/diversity/dhr/oma/events/black-history"" target=""_blank"">Black History Month programming</a> includes our 14th annual Shades of Black show, seminars, and movie screenings. This year’s movie is “Hidden Figures.” As a space-grant institution, we can appreciate the story of how talented but overlooked African-American women were essential in getting astronaut John Glenn into orbit and safely home again. I’m looking forward to seeing this movie soon with my family.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Thank you to the <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/diversity/dhr/oma"" target=""_blank"">Office of Multicultural Affairs</a>, the <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/law/"" target=""_blank"">College of Law</a>, and the MLK/Black History Month Planning Committee and its many representatives from UI and the community, for putting together an educational and engaging program this month. These events help inform a more fully developed understanding of African-American life and history for all people, all year. It’s a time to honestly examine our shortcomings, and work together to create the best possible campus and world.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> We owe a debt of gratitude to individuals like Reginald Reeves and the countless others who have contributed to a more diverse and connected society. That story shapes individual communities, institutions like the University of Idaho, and adds up to a profound and necessary change for our world. </td>

The festival, which runs Thursday through Saturday, Feb. 23-25, will bring approximately 4,200 students from 133 schools throughout Idaho, Washington, Oregon and British Columbia, Canada to campus. That’s about 500 more students than in 2016, Jazz Fest Manager Aaron Mayhugh said. “We are so glad that jazz educators, students and fans are excited about this year’s festival,” Mayhugh said. “With a fantastic lineup of free workshops, as well as three nights of amazing jazz performances, this year’s festival is one that you won’t want to miss.” Ticket sales have more than doubled for both Thursday and Saturday nights and sales for Friday night are up by more than 300 seats. Tickets are available through the University of Idaho Ticket Office located in the ASUI-Kibbie Activity Center, by phone at 1-888-8-UIDAHO or online at www.uidaho.edu/ticketoffice. Prices range from $15-$45 per night, and special UI employee, student and youth ticket prices are available.

Pending final American Bar Association approval, a first-year law program will be available in both the Moscow and Boise locations beginning this fall semester. “A first-year program in Boise rounds out the University of Idaho’s options for a dynamic legal education that leads to great opportunities for graduates,” said President Chuck Staben. “We will be able to continue to build on our success at the Idaho Law and Justice Learning Center in Boise and on our long tradition of excellence in legal education.” Previously, all students completed their first-year in Moscow and then could transition to Boise, if desired, for their second and third year. The addition of first-year classes in Boise will make a Juris Doctor degree fully available at either location. </td>

The SBOE approved the next phase of the project at its meeting Wednesday in Boise. “We are thrilled to move forward with this much-anticipated investment at UI,” President Chuck Staben said. “It is proof of our commitment to providing a great experience for our student-athletes, our students and our fans.” The $30 million project is over halfway to its fundraising goal, which includes funding support from students, alumni, friends and corporations. As fundraising continues, UI will move forward securing the architects and builders needed for a signature wood-engineered facility using mass timber construction. Recognizing the importance of the arena, UI students voted to raise the student facilities fee to help support the project. </td>

As we bring the festival back within our School of Music, we’ve made some changes this year: three days of all on-campus workshops and concerts, a competition track for students with a chance to play on the main stage, and new features such as an academic fair for our visiting students. I sat down with Vanessa Sielert, School of Music associate director and associate professor of saxophone and jazz bands, to learn more about the festival from the perspective of a musician, teacher and festival organizer.</em><br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>You’ve taken a leadership role as we bring this festival back within our School of Music. What changes will students notice? What changes will other festivalgoers notice?</strong><br /> The changes that we’ve made to the festival all center around the student experience. We understand from our experiences in the music education field, as well as from students and director feedback, that a competitive format allows students to strive for excellence and personally meaningful opportunities, such as the chance to perform in the evening concerts among world-class artists. We felt strongly that centralizing the festival back on campus would not only allow the visiting students to experience more of our campus community, but would also better engage our current UI students in the festival. We hope that festivalgoers and our current students will notice an increased energy and excitement at this year’s festival.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Going to three nights instead of four makes sense because we have three nights of competition. We’ve changed the format to make all concerts two-and-a-half hours long, ending every night at 10 p.m. <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/class/jazzfest/tickets"" target=""_blank"">All the concerts</a> are in the Kibbie Dome. Prior to that we had them around campus and at different times; we wanted to make it clear and easy for everybody.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>I find this exciting for students and festival attendees. In the past, we have had some student participants who competed to earn a spot on the main stage, and who are now professional artists.</strong><br /> That’s right. As one example, Grace Kelly, a saxophonist, was a student participant and eventually returned to perform in the jazz festival. I also know several performers in the Seattle area who say that being on the main stage at the Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival was the moment they realized that this is what they wanted to do for the rest of their lives.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>What has been the response from our School of Music to handling the festival? What kind of engagement have you seen?</strong><br /> We are all on board! It’s engaged the faculty in a new way. For instance, we’re offering new daytime workshops Friday and Saturday. These workshops will be on a variety of topics, including double-reed instruments, which aren’t traditionally in jazz ensembles. Students who are “doublers,” who play their double-reed instrument in their orchestra or their concert band, but play their saxophone in their jazz band, can have some experience with our world-class faculty on those instruments. There’s a workshop on the jazz rock era. There’s a workshop on breathing. There’s a workshop on giving an audition. There are a variety of workshops that any musician can gain from.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> One of the things we’ve done is that each of our artists coming to the evening concerts is available for a clinic. For Friday and Saturday those clinics are at the dome at noon, and no student will be turned away. That’s a huge positive. Overall, we’re offering many more clinics than in the past.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>What does the 50th anniversary of the Jazz Festival mean for UI?</strong><br /> It means we have a rich tradition of the jazz festival. This started as a one-day, one-room festival with one guest artist, and it’s grown into a nationally recognized festival that’s three days long, with multiple guest artists, with more than 4,000 students participating. It’s really grown into quite the event <span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif; color: #444444;"">—</span> one of the largest festivals in the country. This year, it has grown again in student participation from last year, and <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2017-february/021417-jazzfest"" target=""_blank"">our ticket sales are up</a>. It’s very exciting.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>This year’s festival theme is “Grounded in Tradition. Breaking New Ground.” What does that mean?</strong><br /> Jazz and jazz musicians have always embodied this theme. Jazz music is much about paying tribute to the past while looking forward, pushing boundaries. We wanted the festival to reflect that spirit. We wanted to respect the traditions of the past, respect the core principle of education being primary at the festival, but push it to new levels, experiment, try new things, and break out of the mold.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>You are particularly involved in the “Jazz in Schools” part of the festival. Tell us about that program.</strong><br /> Jazz in Schools started while Lionel Hampton was here, and he was a big proponent of getting out to rural schools and giving students an experience with this American art form. We send musicians out to dozens of schools leading up to the festival. For a lot of elementary students this might be their first experience with live music. We’ve sent four different ensembles out to three or four schools per day in Idaho and Washington, to towns like Lewiston, Pullman, Garfield, Palouse, Moscow, and more.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>What should we know about this year’s lineup of musicians?</strong><br /> Tonight, we have two Benny Goodman quartets. Joseph Doubleday and Felix Peikli will be doing Lionel Hampton-Benny Goodman tunes very similar to what Lionel Hampton and Goodman were doing back in the day. Stefon Harris and Anat Cohen will then play the same piece directly following, but take it in a different direction. It’s a play on our “Grounded in Tradition. Breaking New Ground” theme, and I think it’s a unique thing people will take away from the festival. We will also have New York Voices, a vocal quartet who will put on a fabulous show.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> On Saturday we’ll have the Lionel Hampton Big Band, the core of the group, with our faculty and some professional musicians filling in. Claudio Roditi and Julia Keefe will play as well. And Jason Marsalis of the Marsalis family will play vibraphone with the band. To close out the night we have Esperanza Spalding, a Grammy award winner as “Best New Artist” and a very talented composer, bassist and vocalist.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>Current UI students can buy tickets for only $15 dollars. Are there other ways for students to be involved and see performances?</strong><br /> Absolutely. They can volunteer to be on site at any of the performances, or they can volunteer to drive artists around, or do any number of volunteer opportunities. <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/class/jazzfest/get-involved"" target=""_blank"">It takes 400 volunteers for the festival to run smoothly</a>, so we definitely need and welcome those volunteers. If they volunteer for four hours they get a voucher for a ticket to an evening performance.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> For those who wish to just get a taste of what the festival has to offer without volunteering this year, all daytime activities are free and open to the public. People can come and experience student performances and/or one of our “meet the artist” or educational workshops for free during the day <span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif; color: #444444;"">—</span> before they purchase their tickets to the evening concert.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>There’s a new academic fair this year at the festival. What is the impetus behind that?</strong><br /> We’re having booths from every college just before the young artists contest begins on Saturday. From 3:-4:30 p.m. all the colleges will have a table on the Kibbie Dome floor to the right of the stage. Students can feel free to walk through and learn about many of the colleges. It’s a nice opportunity for students who are here to experience more of our campus and learn more about our school.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>Many of these students have a strong interest in music, but most of these students will come to college and pursue another discipline.</strong><br /> That’s correct. Hopefully, they will continue to play music and be a part of the School of Music in some fashion. Whether they are in the marching band and they’re an engineer, whether they’re in the Vandaleers concert choir and they’re studying biology, that’s up to them. We offer the opportunities for all students to participate and enjoy their lifelong engagement with music.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <em><strong>Thank you, Vanessa. </strong>And thanks also to School of Music and others making this festival possible: Dean Andrew Kersten (CLASS), Torrey Lawrence (School of Music Director), Aaron Mayhugh (Festival Manager), and Vern Sielert (Festival Artistic Advisor). Thank you to our student, faculty and staff volunteers. And thanks to the many donors and sponsors without whom this festival would not be possible.</em> </td>

After discovering that the University of Idaho’s <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/academic-affairs/operation-education"" target=""_blank"">Operation Education</a> program provides important transitional support in the educational and personal lives of U.S. military veterans with disabilities, the Taylors made a generous commitment to the program. Established in 2006, Operation Education provides veterans with scholarships, adaptive equipment, tutoring, internships and job placement. “The University of Idaho recognizes that, for many veterans, returning to productive and satisfying lives requires far more than financial assistance,” said Nancy Byers ‘69, current Operation Education advisory board chair and mother, spouse and daughter to U.S. veterans. “Financial assistance such as Don’s is what makes this program and the University of Idaho both special and successful,” said former program advisory board chair David Decker ‘71. “We are very grateful for his generosity and support.” For information on giving to Operation Education, contact Jim Zuba at 208-885-4142 or <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/email/mailto:jzuba@uidaho.edu']);"" href=""mailto:jzuba@uidaho.edu"" target=""_blank"">jzuba@uidaho.edu</a>. </td>

Newly admitted students who meet the criteria will be automatically awarded the WUE tuition and fee rate, which is 1.5 times the in-state tuition and fee rate. The award is a savings of more than $11,000 a year over the full out-of-state tuition and fee costs. For new freshmen, WUE criteria include an unweighted GPA of 3.2 or higher from an accredited high school, or a minimum 22 ACT/1020 SAT for home-schooled students or graduates from a non-accredited high school. New transfer students who are residents of Washington or Oregon qualify with a 3.0 transfer GPA or higher. The awards are renewable with a minimum GPA. </td>

A great experience that positions students for lifelong success doesn’t stop at the state line <span class=""st"" data-hveid=""41"" data-ved=""0ahUKEwjemuHq2bjSAhUBMGMKHWUcBKQQ4EUIKTAB"">—</span> that's why the University of Idaho has <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2017-february/021717-wue"" target=""_blank"">revitalized its Western Undergraduate Exchange (WUE) program for Washington and Oregon residents</a>.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Our university has long been a destination for high-quality, affordable education. Many students come to Vandal country each year from Washington and Oregon. But we heard concerns about cost for many prospective students from our western neighbors. We listened to those concerns, and we are taking action.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Beginning this summer, <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/wue"" target=""_blank"">the expanded WUE program</a> means new first-year and transfer students from Washington and Oregon will save $11,000 per year over typical out-of-state tuition. First-year students qualify with a minimum 3.2 GPA from an accredited high school or minimum 22 ACT/1020 SAT for home-schooled students or graduates from a non-accredited high school. Transfer students qualify with a 3.0 or higher GPA. The awards are renewable with the maintenance of a minimum 2.5 GPA. No separate application is necessary <span class=""st"" data-hveid=""41"" data-ved=""0ahUKEwjemuHq2bjSAhUBMGMKHWUcBKQQ4EUIKTAB"">—</span> the WUE rates will be awarded automatically in the application process.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Those guidelines underpin a straightforward and easy-to-understand program. I often hear from parents and students about the complexity of applying for college. I have sent three children of my own on to higher education and also had sometimes frustrating experiences. At UI we have decided that we can and will reduce the barriers to higher education. We recognize the regional need for higher education to provide a pathway for individual success and broadly shared economic prosperity.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The expanded WUE program allows the University of Idaho to enhance its position as a great value among public research universities. For instance, based on academic excellence, affordability and outstanding career outcomes, The Princeton Review just named UI one of its top <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings/colleges-that-pay-you-back']);"" href=""https://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings/colleges-that-pay-you-back"" target=""_blank"">“Colleges That Pay You Back”</a> <span class=""st"" data-hveid=""41"" data-ved=""0ahUKEwjemuHq2bjSAhUBMGMKHWUcBKQQ4EUIKTAB"">—</span> one of only 200 schools nationwide, and the only one in Idaho. I want to make sure that excellence is affordable and accessible for students across the Northwest.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> We have a lot to offer at the University of Idaho. I invite Washington and Oregon residents to see for themselves what the Vandal experience looks like for their interests, and for their budgets. Visit <a href=""http://uidaho.edu/wue"" target=""_blank"">uidaho.edu/wue</a> for detailed WUE information. I think many students and families will find that this enhanced WUE program makes one of the best values in higher education that much more attractive.<br /> &nbsp; </td>

McNichols ’50, one of Idaho’s most highly respected jurists. The fund supports an intramural moot court competition and the outstanding oralist receives the Ray McNichols Memorial Award. Mike and Katie have made generous annual contributions to the fund since its inception. “We are grateful to Mike for creating this fund for our students,” said Dean Mark Adams. “That support, along with the support of over 60 other individual donors, has provided our students with the valuable practical skills training that is so important to their legal education and future careers.” Many contributions to the endowment have come from former law clerks of Judge McNichols.

In northwestern states — including Idaho, Washington, Oregon, and Montana — humans started about half of all wildfires. The startling numbers show the importance of the governments and citizens of Northwest states working to reduce human-started fires, which often have direct impacts on infrastructure given their tendency to occur in the wildland-urban interface, said <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/sci/geography/people/faculty/jabatzoglou"" target=""_blank"">University of Idaho researcher John Abatzoglou</a>. Abatzoglou, an associate professor of geography in the UI College of Science, worked with project leaders Bethany Bradley of the University of Massachusetts Amherst and Jennifer Balch of the University of Colorado-Boulder on the analysis, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science. “Not all fire is bad, but humans are intentionally and unintentionally adding ignitions to the landscape in areas and seasons when natural ignitions are sparse,” Abatzoglou said. “We can’t easily control how dry fuels get, or lightning — but we do have some control over human-started ignitions.” </td>

Among public colleges and universities in the greater Northwest, only the University of Washington also made the list. The Princeton Review’s methodology includes the use of institutional and student surveys combined with PayScale’s alumni earnings data. Financial aid is an important component of the analysis — UI awarded more than $25 million in financial aid to students in fall 2016. <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings/colleges-that-pay-you-back/methodology']);"" href=""https://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings/colleges-that-pay-you-back/methodology"" target=""_blank"">According to The Princeton Review</a>, “Students who attend these schools don't have to mortgage their futures to pay for their degrees — and we believe they will graduate with great career prospects.” The rankings also reflect student opinions of teaching quality and the accessibility of professors. The Princeton Review concludes, “the 200 we chose as our Colleges That Pay You Back 2017 are, in our opinion, truly the most exceptional in the nation at delivering great academics, affordable cost, and great career foundations. We strongly recommend and salute the colleges we present here for all that they do to help their students with need afford to attend them while delivering an amazing college experience that's worth every penny.” </td>

Our capacity to deliver those opportunities recently received a boost when the State Board of Education approved a new Bachelor of Science in medical sciences in UI's <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/sci"" target=""_blank"">College of Science</a>.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/www.idahostatesman.com/opinion/readers-opinion/article61190487.html']);"" href=""http://www.idahostatesman.com/opinion/readers-opinion/article61190487.html"" target=""_blank"">Medical education is a pipeline</a> that begins in a key way with the transition to postsecondary education. We wanted to clarify the pathway for high school students to plan for a career as a physician. Often a “pre-med” track supplies coursework necessary for medical school qualification within an existing major, such as biology, chemistry or physics. This is actually the somewhat circuitous route my family <span style=""color: #444444; font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;"">—</span> Mary Beth and our three children <span style=""color: #444444; font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;"">—</span> took to medical school. A medical sciences degree packages those medical school prerequisites within a clearly defined major, with all the benefits of focused advising, waypoints and recognition from medical schools as a stamp of readiness.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Importantly, this new curriculum is appropriate not just for future physicians, but for careers across the burgeoning health care sector. Health care is 20 percent of our nation’s economy, and whether you are a medical writer, health care administrator, lawyer, allied health professional or any other related profession, there are great employment opportunities for rewarding careers that impact health and well-being. According to analysis by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, health care professions can expect 29 percent growth in the next seven years, adding millions of new jobs with high median annual salaries. Those careers can now be launched with a medical sciences degree from the University of Idaho.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Without adding new administrative capacity or funding needs, we have created a strong program that will attract students. We project approximately 50 initial enrollments, a 75-student overall enrollment, and then at least 45 graduates per year. Whether they are going on to jobs in health care <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/academics/wwami/academics/trust-program"" target=""_blank"">i</a><a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/academics/wwami/academics/trust-program"" target=""_blank"">n our rural communities</a> or in our growing urban areas, or taking another step with advancement to medical school, students are going to be well-prepared to shape the future — theirs and ours.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Last year we followed up on important curricular changes to the <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/academics/wwami"" target=""_blank"">Idaho WWAMI program</a> — Idaho’s public medical school, providing access to one of the best medical educations in the country — with growth in the number of slots available to Idahoans in that program. We are moving forward with renovation of our WWAMI facility in Moscow, and looking at ways to increase the number of residencies in Idaho. This medical sciences undergraduate program, for future physicians and health care professionals of all kinds, builds on that success and innovation.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> I’ve seen firsthand the rigor of medical education, as Mary Beth completed her degree, and now my two sons are taking on medical school and our daughter is completing coursework with plans to apply. It takes a lot of commitment to eventually be in a position to make a difference in people’s lives through medicine. I appreciate the State Board’s recognition that this medical science education degree can more effectively bring students into that pipeline and succeed. This medical sciences degree offers the right prescription for our state’s future. </td>

This past fall, the <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/giving/engr"" target=""_blank"">University of Idaho College of Engineering</a> kicked-off the Grand Challenge Scholars Program (GCSP), a national initiative launched by the National Academy of Engineers (NAE) designed to prepare students for solving society’s “grand challenges.” The NAE identified 14 “Grand Challenges of the 21st Century” <span style=""color: #444444; font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;"">—</span> challenges such as securing cyberspace, providing access to clean water and reverse-engineering the brain. College of Engineering Dean Larry Stauffer joined 122 schools nationwide in a commitment to graduating 20 Grand Challenge Scholars per year over the next 10 years. Micron’s support helps students progress through the program and their engineering degree. “This is a great opportunity for Micron to be part of the national movement to change the paradigm in engineering education across the country,” said Vishal Saxena, UI Micron Endowed Professor in Microelectronics. “We are in step with the National Academy’s motivation and vision to prepare engineers to be world changers. The GCSP will pilot innovative educational approaches that will eventually become the mainstream educational paradigm for all engineering students.” For information on supporting the Grand Challenges Scholars Program, contact Mary Lee Ryba at 208-755-4916 or <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/email/mailto:mryba@uidaho.edu']);"" href=""mailto:mryba@uidaho.edu"" target=""_blank"">mryba@uidaho.edu</a>. </td>

For many Vandals, that’s an opportunity to serve their communities. The <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/student-involvement/volunteer/asb"" target=""_blank"">Alternative Service Break</a> program at UI finds students involved in important projects that lend a helping hand to those in need. That spirit of service makes a difference for families and communities across our region and our world.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> This week 39 Vandals are serving across the Pacific Northwest. They are working with the Oregon Department of Forestry, building river access trails and helping with native plant restoration projects. Another team is in Seattle, doing home repairs in under-resourced neighborhoods. These practical projects offer hands-on experience while strengthening engagement as citizens. I’m glad our neighboring states have a firsthand look at what Idaho Vandals are all about.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Alternative Service Break participants are also doing good work where it is needed here in Idaho. They are in Cottonwood, helping people in our corrections systems with math and language skill development, career planning and money management, as they prepare for a second chance after incarceration. <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/www.kmvt.com/content/news/U-of-I-students-serving-Twin-Falls-schools-during-alternative-spring-break-416292423.html']);"" href=""http://www.kmvt.com/content/news/U-of-I-students-serving-Twin-Falls-schools-during-alternative-spring-break-416292423.html"" target=""_blank"">Vandals are also in Twin Falls</a>, connecting with refugees to understand the integration process and offer support and assistance for people who have fled their home countries because of persecution.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The good work accomplished by ASB Vandals doesn’t stop at our nation’s borders, either. International trips take place during winter break. This winter nearly 50 students went to Nicaragua, the Philippines and Ecuador. They helped communities with sustainable energy, sanitation technology and community gardens. That two-week experience made a lasting difference for communities. I have no doubt our Vandals also gained perspective and experience that will inform the choices they make in their education and their lives. They share their insight and growth with our broader UI community when they come back from such trips.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Thanks to the <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/student-involvement/volunteer"" target=""_blank"">Center for Volunteerism and Social Action</a> in our <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/student-involvement"" target=""_blank"">Department of Student Involvement</a> for coordinating these meaningful experiences. And congratulations to the students who get involved. If current or future Vandals are looking to make a difference, I encourage them check out the opportunities available through ASB trips.<br /> <br /> As a university community, we know that we grow stronger together through service. This year the University of Idaho was again named to the <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2016-october/101216-volunteerism"" target=""_blank"">President’s Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll</a>, the highest such honor for schools. Getting involved and giving back is who we are as Vandals. I’m proud to see that spirit of service in action. </td>

The new center will be led by Shirley Luckhart and Ed Lewis, who will move their research programs from UC Davis. They will begin work on the Moscow campus May 15 to create the center as a multidisciplinary collaboration to build a more sustainable human ecosystem through research, teaching and outreach. The pair were recruited to UI by College of Agricultural and Life Sciences Dean Michael Parrella, who worked with them at Davis before he moved to UI in 2016. “They are outstanding scientists and I believe their work here will help transform the University of Idaho’s scientific reach,” Parrella said. “Dr. Luckhart's joint appointment between the College of Science and the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences highlights the connectivity between the two colleges and will move programs forward in both.” </td>

Now, students looking to build their future through the best legal education in Idaho have one more place to start. The <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/law/news/features/2015/idaho-law-and-justice-learning-center"" target=""_blank"">Idaho Law and Justice Learning Center</a>, across the street from the Capitol, Supreme Court and State Bar in the heart of downtown Boise, is now home to a full, three-year Juris Doctor curriculum, complementing the three-year curriculum in Moscow. This is a valuable addition to the legal education landscape in the Northwest.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Last week <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2017-march/031617-collegeoflaw"" target=""_blank"">the American Bar Association awarded the final approval</a> for our Boise first-year curriculum. This follows the <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2017-february/021617-collegeoflaw"" target=""_blank"">State Board of Education’s sign-off</a> on the program in February. We are ready to welcome a class of first-year students this fall. I congratulate those students on choosing a Juris Doctor program renowned for its excellence, its successful outcomes and its affordability.&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;<br /> In the legal, civic and economic center of Idaho, the College of Law's Boise location provides another pathway for learning and professional preparation. Our Boise law program is well-known for its clinics that help community members in tax law, small business law, and economic development, among other areas. UI Law is a leader in externships, helping students find real-world placement experiences and contribute to organizations while earning their degree. In January, National Jurist magazine recognized the college's commitment to service on its annual public service honor roll. That exemplifies the Vandal spirit of service we so often discuss.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Job placement rates in the College of Law are among the highest in the Northwest and alongside Ivy League schools in the top 30 nationwide. Because the degree is so affordable <span style=""color: #444444; font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;"">—</span> much lower in cost than private options in Idaho, and a bargain compared to attending regional public law schools as out-of-state students <span style=""color: #444444; font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;"">—</span> graduates emerge into the job market with low debt and the ability to choose the professional option that is meaningful to them. That combination of excellence and affordability led PreLaw magazine to name UI the <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/bit.ly/2mW1tXE']);"" href=""http://bit.ly/2mW1tXE"" target=""_blank"">No. 8 Best Value</a> in the nation in fall 2016.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Expanding access to our law program comes at little added cost to the state of Idaho, but offers great benefit to our state and students. Whether they are going to practice law or serve in any of the numerous fields and capacities for which a Juris Doctor is great preparation, Vandal law graduates will contribute to the growth, prosperity and reputation of Idaho.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> I’m grateful for our leadership in the College of Law, including Dean Mark L. Adams; our law faculty working to prepare for this expansion; our <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/law/about/law-advisory-council"" target=""_blank"">Law Advisory Council</a> and highly supportive alumni; the Idaho State Board of Education and the American Bar Association. This is a win for students, for legal education and for the state of Idaho. </td>

Through a gift of stock and a future annuity gift, this scholarship endowment not only honors the legacy of a special UI alumna, but will also positively invest in the lives of students in the years to come. Students pursuing a degree in the Colleges of Science or Education, or the Margaret Ritchie School of Family and Consumer Sciences in the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences (CALS), are eligible for support through this endowment. “Scholarships like this impact our ability to retain the best students, by providing them with significant financial support,” said Michael Parrella, dean of CALS. “I, along with the other college deans, am so grateful for this tremendous generosity.” For more information about giving, contact Eric Bennett in the <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/giving/science"" target=""_blank"">College of Science</a> at <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/email/mailto:ebennett@uidaho.edu']);"" href=""mailto:ebennett@uidaho.edu"" target=""_blank"">ebennett@uidaho.edu</a>, Marta McClintock in the <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/giving/ed"" target=""_blank"">College of Education</a> at <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/email/mailto:martam@uidaho.edu']);"" href=""mailto:martam@uidaho.edu"" target=""_blank"">martam@uidaho.edu</a>, or Jen Root in the <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/giving/cals"" target=""_blank"">College of Agricultural and Life Sciences</a> at <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/email/mailto:jroot@uidaho.edu']);"" href=""mailto:jroot@uidaho.edu"" target=""_blank"">jroot@uidaho.edu</a>.<br /> &nbsp; </td>

Her $25,000 gift to the <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/giving/ed"" target=""_blank"">College of Education</a> established the Shirley A. Wentz Education Scholarship Endowment, supporting future elementary education teachers from Ada and Canyon counties in Idaho. Wentz’s wish was to help future educators enjoy the rewards she received from introducing young readers to the power of books and reading. “It is quite fitting that the 1,500th endowed scholarship would come from Shirley Wentz, lifelong educator and die-hard Vandal,” said Ali Carr-Chellman, dean of UI’s College of Education. “We are so grateful for the help that Shirley’s endowed scholarship provides to our students in the College of Education.” Endowments like the one left by Wentz are invested over the long term to support students, faculty, research and university programs. The 1,500 endowments amount to more than $10.2 million in scholarship and program support distributed each year — and $165 million distributed since 1959. </td>

The study was commissioned by the Idaho Dairymen’s Association and updates a 2009 analysis of how the dairy industry’s workforce impacts communities in Idaho. “Immigration has profound economic and social impacts on communities,” said Priscilla Salant, senior researcher at the McClure Center. “In the case of South Central Idaho, these changes have been largely positive and going on for a generation.” The study found that increasing automation in response to labor shortages and narrow profit margins, along with changing immigration policies and continued integration of immigrants and their children, will influence community well-being in the future. The dairy industry will continue to be a driving force in the region going forward.

In North Idaho, that mission goes hand-in-hand with supporting economic development. Recognizing an opportunity to support this imperative, the Idaho legislature has followed through on an investment in a four-year computer science degree in Coeur d’Alene, funding the fourth year of the program this spring. This investment in our state’s students reflects the belief that the increasingly technology-focused economy of the region will thrive with a stable source of highly skilled and motivated graduates.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The UI Coeur d’Alene computer science program partners with North Idaho College. Students take their first two years toward the degree at NIC, then seamlessly transfer to complete the third- and fourth-year curriculum at the University of Idaho, earning a Bachelor of Science in <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/engr/departments/cs"" target=""_blank"">computer science</a> through our <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/engr"" target=""_blank"">College of Engineering</a>. We have upward of 80 students already in this pipeline and invested in faculty last year to begin the program. Idaho’s investment in a fourth-year program this spring means more teaching resources for fall 2017 to accommodate our students. It also allows the program to seek ABET accreditation, a standard of excellence for computer science programs and an assurance of quality for students and our state.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> An exciting component of the computer science curriculum is the cooperative education track, developed in partnership with the STEM Action Center with support from the STEM legislative caucus. The track emphasizes internships with local industry. Students will divide their program between focused internships with specific educational goals that reinforce coursework and with semesters in the classroom. That means students will graduate with industry applicable skills, on-the-job experience, and a built-in network of employer connections. Cooperative education offers a win-win for students and industry – experience for students on their way to a great job, and support and resources for industries as they innovate and expand.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/degree-finder/computer-science/bs-computer-science"" target=""_blank"">computer science degree</a> is an important enhancement to UI offerings in <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/cda"" target=""_blank"">the Coeur d’Alene area</a>. Our University Research Park in Post Falls supports economic and community development with an emphasis on growth and sustainability. It is home to UI’s Cybersecurity Training and Operations Center, training up to 350 people through 2018 to work in the information technology sector in North Idaho and eastern Washington. We’re connecting in the community with activities such as our robotics workshops, our Dign’IT summer coding camps for young people, and our partnership with Gizmo-CDA, the community makerspace. We continue to <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/cda/academics"" target=""_blank"">offer a range</a> of bachelor’s and advanced degree options, in everything from education to executive MBAs. We’re proud of the success we’ve had, and appreciate the role of businesses, community organizations, and city and state leaders in partnering with UI to make those achievements possible.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> This is an exciting time for Vandal country in North Idaho. Technology is key to a strong economy and a prosperous future for our region, and UI is helping lay the groundwork for that success.<br /> &nbsp; </td>

Baxter ’66 invested in property near Cascade, Idaho. Now a long-time resident of Vermont, Baxter decided to make a gift of this property to the UI to, in his words, “repay my school for the benefits it gave me.” He also wanted to honor two special individuals close to him: his late father, Lawrence H. Baxter, and First Lieutenant Kay Kimura, USMC, a close friend and classmate from Nampa Senior High School who lost his life in Vietnam. “If my gift to the University can keep alive their memories and provide assistance to coming generations of students who seek their own University of Idaho experiences, I will have repaid some small portion of UI’s gift to me,” said Baxter.

The publication is a project sponsored by the UI Office of Undergraduate Research that brings together a team of student writers and photographers to tell the stories of their fellow students and their work in research, scholarship and creative activity. Vandals in Focus features student stories from every college, as well as profiles of faculty mentors. “Hands-on research experiences allow students to develop as scholars and innovators while gaining experience they can apply to life after college,” President Staben said in his introductory message in the report. “Students at UI don’t just receive knowledge — they help unlock and unleash it. I am proud to see that Vandal tradition showcased here.” </td>

It supports students, bolsters academic programs, and enhances research and scholarship. It’s an important way we join in the shared enterprise of shaping a bright future. Today’s event highlights the very human side of that connection.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> For students, the Celebration of Scholarships is a chance to thank donors <span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif; color: #444444;"">—</span> putting a face to the support that plays an important role in their educational experience. For many, meeting a scholarship donor is affirming and motivating. Here’s what we heard from one student, an agribusiness and political science major: “Knowing that someone else believes in my ability makes me treasure learning so much more,” he said. “I think it gives me a responsibility to do my best academically and personally to take full advantage of the opportunities I have been given.”<br /> &nbsp;<br /> For donors, our scholarship celebration provides a window into the stories behind their financial support. Donors are alumni, faculty and staff, and community members. They hear firsthand the appreciation of students. They learn their stories, their interests, their aspirations. The generosity behind their giving becomes less abstract; it’s more than a check, more than a donation. It’s a hand reached out to a fellow member of the Vandal family.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> It’s difficult singling out a particular donor story because so many Vandals are so generous and considerate in their support of students <span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif; color: #444444;"">—</span> after all, the “Inspiring Futures” campaign saw more than 40,000 Vandals offer their contributions, their statements of belief, to this institution. But I’m glad to welcome Peggy and Wayne Thiessen, among many others, to campus for this event. Both graduated from UI; scholarships helped Peggy complete her education, and Wayne points to a graduate fellowship on the way to a master’s degree as assistance that helped him on the path to a great career.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The Thiessens <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/giving/cals/impact-stories/thiessen"" target=""_blank"">have supported UI in many ways</a>, with a scholarship in soil science one part of that legacy. An abiding belief in the ongoing benefits of giving back drives their giving <span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif; color: #444444;"">—</span> a “pay it forward” mindset. “We’re one or two generations away from those students, and it’s a unique opportunity for us to get to know them,” Wayne said.<br /> <br /> “We believe that students are the future,” Peggy added. “Helping them be the best prepared that they can be is a wise investment in the future for our country, for everybody.”<br /> &nbsp;<br /> We’re grateful for the support of the Thiessens and the many people who make the choice to invest in the future of our Vandal students. Here’s what another student, a psychology major, told the donors who supported her scholarship: “Without your help, my dreams would be just that, a dream,” she said. “You have helped make my dream a reality, and I am extremely grateful.”<br /> <br /> Thank you to all the Vandal family members who have reached out their hands to invest in those dreams, and to the students who are taking the initiative to pull themselves up to a bright future.<br /> &nbsp; </td>

They believe in opening doors to science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) and, through the Ferenc Family Foundation of Brooklyn, have made a generous gift to University of Idaho’s STEM Access program. STEM Access is one of seven TRiO projects funded at the College of Education; it connects students from the Lewis-Clark Valley to a path that supports high school efforts and leads to college, especially in the areas of STEM. Kyra Ferenc, a Vandal alumna and former educator who believes in encouraging a love of learning and critical thinking, chose to invest in the program after seeing the passion and enthusiasm of the program’s director, Kirsten LaPaglia. The donation to STEM Access will help further the education and foster excitement in youth who might not otherwise have an opportunity to explore higher education.

The concert, scheduled for 8:30 p.m. Sunday, April 9, is the Vandaleers’ second at Carnegie Hall. Their first performance was in 1991. “For musicians, an opportunity to perform on the historic and acoustically vibrant stage of Carnegie Hall is a great achievement that we all dream of,” said Michael Murphy, director of choral activities and associate professor of music in the UI’s Lionel Hampton School of Music. “The Vandaleers will have the honor to perform a solo concert that will show a mastery of a variety of music.”&nbsp;At the concert, the Vandaleers will feature a varied repertoire of songs from the United States, Sweden, Norway, France, Germany and Haiti. The Vandaleers are traveling to New York as their 2017 annual tour destination. Since Murphy’s arrival as director in 2008, Vandaleers tours have included trips throughout the Northwest and Europe. </td>

This spring we are pleased with the investments Gov. Otter and the Idaho Legislature have made in the excellence of our programs and facilities. A number of projects bear special mention:<br /> &nbsp; 
                     <ul> 
                      <li style=""text-size-adjust: 100%;""><a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/cda/news-events/featured-stories/cda"" target=""_blank"">Fourth-year computer science degree in Coeur d’Alene</a>. As described in a recent Friday Letter, this partnership with North Idaho College allows students to complete all four years of a computer science degree in Coeur d’Alene. This is an investment in students who want to find a place in the increasingly technology-focused economy of North Idaho.</li> 
                      <li style=""text-size-adjust: 100%;""><a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/www.lib.uidaho.edu']);"" href=""http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/"" target=""_blank"">UI Library investment</a>: The legislature supported significant new funding for the University of Idaho Library. This will allow us to add two full-time positions and make other needed technology improvements. Our Library is a hub for student academic work and for research and scholarship, and for the development of new ideas and solutions that benefit society. Expanding our Library’s capacity means enhancing a valuable resource for our university community <span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif; color: #444444;"">—</span> and our state.</li> 
                      <li style=""text-size-adjust: 100%;"">Change in Employee Compensation. A 3 percent compensation increase approved by the legislature means the university will keep pace in our ability to recruit and retain talented faculty and staff. We must remain competitive in order to serve students and the state with our best teaching, research and scholarship, and outreach.</li> 
                     </ul> &nbsp;<br /> Two investments from the Permanent Building Fund also stand out: 
                     <ul> 
                      <li style=""text-size-adjust: 100%;""><a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/research/entities/cafe"" target=""_blank"">The Center for Agrculture, Food and the Environment (CAFE)</a>. A $10 million appropriation will help the University of Idaho create a new center for research and education connected to food production and processing. We will have project details soon. This is an exciting project that supports the growth and increased sustainability of key Idaho industries, such as dairy and processing.</li> 
                      <li style=""text-size-adjust: 100%;"">Idaho WWAMI building renovation. The <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/academics/wwami"" target=""_blank"">Idaho WWAMI program</a> <span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif; color: #444444;"">—</span> our state’s medical education partnership with the top-ranked University of Washington School of Medicine <span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif; color: #444444;"">—</span> has doubled in student size over the past five years. Permanent Building Fund support will allow us to renovate the Idaho WWAMI building on our Moscow campus and add clinical and anatomy laboratory space.</li> 
                     </ul> &nbsp;<br /> Several other budgetary items also are important: continued support of the Agricultural Research and Extension System; our Idaho Geological Survey and Forest Utilization Research programs; and maintenance and operations costs for facilities. The Idaho WWAMI program will also see important funding to continue preparing the highly skilled medical practitioners of the future <span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif; color: #444444;"">—</span> physicians and other professionals who will serve communities right here in Idaho.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> We appreciate the support of the governor and the legislature this session. Investment in the state’s land-grant research university pays off in a better-prepared, more prosperous Idaho for us all. </td>

Jim was a new assistant professor in the College of Natural Resources, and Dawn was pursuing a teaching certificate to complement her master’s degree and interest in environmental education. Now, almost 41 years and 35 years of cumulative giving later, Jim, professor emeritus in CNR and a freelance writer, and Dawn, local business owner and longtime chair of the Moscow school district’s Board of Trustees, continue their loyal support of UI and Idaho education. “A person ought to be supportive of the institution that supported him and so many students over the years,” Jim said. “Education is the foundation of a strong nation.” The Fazios have championed a wide variety of university initiatives — from the Douglas L. Gilbert Scholarship that supports conservation communication, to the Library Dean’s Excellence Renovation Fund that resulted in a group study room dedication in their name. “Jim and Dawn have contributed to bettering the lives of so many students and faculty in their 43-year association with the UI,” said Nick Sanyal, colleague and professor in CNR.

According to Zippia, “Not all schools are equal in this, and some colleges are vastly more supportive of their students’ post-graduation concerns than others.” The ranking system was based on data drawn from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, or IPEDS. The ranking also highlights the earnings by Vandal graduates — the top earnings among graduates of any public institution in the state, according to the <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/www.payscale.com/college-salary-report/best-schools-by-state/bachelors/idaho']);"" href=""http://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report/best-schools-by-state/bachelors/idaho"" target=""_blank"">2016-2017 PayScale College Salary Report</a>. </td>

But more innocuous natural resources, like rivers and streams, contribute as well. A <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2017-april/041017-greenhousegases"" target=""_blank"">research team led by the University of Idaho</a> has found that the form and structure of rivers and streams is an important factor in greenhouse gas emissions — and small rivers produce more than big ones. Civil engineering Associate Professor Daniele Tonina and postdoctoral researcher Alessandra Marzadri at the University of Idaho, along with their partners at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana and the University of Trento in Trento, Italy, have used these findings to develop a new model to predict emissions at a global level. Their work was published in&nbsp;the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. “We developed a model that can be used at large continental and even global scale,” Tonina said. “The new model provides the needed feedback to help quantify human impact on climate change at the global scale, and it could be used by agencies to provide scientific basis and data to help climate-related decisions in different parts of the world.” </td>

These dedicated professionals are the primary reason UI delivers a transformative educational experience. They are the key to UI’s leadership in great outcomes for graduates, as well as for innovation and discovery that makes an impact across our state and world. As we approach the close of our academic year, I want to congratulate our faculty and staff and highlight their excellence.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Next week at our <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/faculty-staff/excellence-awards"" target=""_blank"">University Excellence Awards</a> we are proud to present two UI professors with our highest faculty honor — the rank of University Distinguished Professor. <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/class/english/graduate/mfa-creative-writing/mfa-faculty/kim-barnes"" target=""_blank"">Kim Barnes</a>, professor of creative writing in our English department, joined UI in 1986. An acclaimed author of three novels and two memoirs, including the Pulitzer Prize-nominated “In the Wilderness: Coming of Age in an Unknown Country,” she is also a committed teacher who exemplifies the excellence of our <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/class/english/graduate/mfa-creative-writing"" target=""_blank"">creative writing program</a>. <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/engr/departments/ece/our-people/faculty/brian-johnson"" target=""_blank"">Brian K. Johnson</a>, Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories Endowed Chair in Power Engineering, has been a Vandal since 1992. He is a talented researcher, internationally recognized in the field of <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/engr/departments/ece"" target=""_blank"">power engineering</a>, and he is as dedicated to mentoring our students as he is to his field. Our Distinguished Professors have gone above and beyond in exemplifying the Vandal traditions of excellence in their fields, service to students and commitment to a caring community.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> One example of our many deserving staff honorees is Jesse Martinez, recipient of our Arthur Maxwell Taylor Excellence in Diversity Award. Jesse first came to UI as a participant in the <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/diversity/dhr/college-assistance-migrant-program"" target=""_blank"">College Assistance Migratory Program (CAMP)</a>. Jesse came full circle to lead recruiting and to serve as associate director for CAMP, which helps students from rural and farmworker backgrounds succeed at UI. He now leads our <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/diversity/dhr/oma"" target=""_blank"">Office of Multicultural Affairs</a> and also serves on UI’s Latino Advisory Council and Diversity Council.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Next Wednesday, I’m pleased to attend our <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/faculty-staff/staff-council/staff-awards"" target=""_blank"">Staff Awards Luncheon</a>, honoring our outstanding staff members who contribute to the programs and essential functions of our university. We also celebrate the staff who have retired after long service to UI, in many cases more than 30 years. Many staff have also contributed to an endowment to support aspiring Vandals with scholarships <span class=""tgc"" style=""font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;"">—</span> a “pay it forward” approach to support the next generation of Vandals. The passion of our staff is one of the university’s greatest assets.<br /> <br /> Faculty and staff may enter higher education for many reasons, but people stay in this profession because they care. They want the best for students and for their university. Students and families looking to understand who we are and what we do at the university will find few better examples than these faculty and staff honorees. </td>

John established the Vernon Burlison Memorial Fund in 1997 in memory of his father, a professor emeritus in the College of Natural Resources. The fund offers scholarship and educational programming support for human and social justice issues, as well as underrepresented communities at the University of Idaho. “These resources are dedicated to making a difference in education and broaden understanding by bringing diverse and controversial ideas to the campus community,” said John Burlison. In addition to more than doubling his annual contribution, John also gave a generous current use gift this year — significantly increasing his giving for key resources in the name of his father. “John’s vision and support make a permanent difference for the LGBTQA community,” said Julia Keleher, director of the <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/diversity/dhr/lgbtqa"" target=""_blank"">LGBTQA Office</a>.

An international team of researchers, including Tim Bartholomaus, an assistant professor of geography in the UI College of Science, <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2017-april/041717-glaciers"" target=""_blank"">have found that the glaciers’ shapes influence how quickly they thin and melt</a> — allowing them to identify which glaciers are most likely to contribute to sea level rise. The Greenland Ice Sheet is the second-largest ice sheet on Earth and has been losing mass for decades, a trend scientists have linked to a warming climate. However, the mass change experienced by individual coastal glaciers, which flow out from the ice sheet and into the ocean, is highly variable. This makes predicting the ice sheet’s impact on future sea-level rise difficult. “The approach we demonstrate here allows us to identify which outlet glaciers are not yet changing rapidly, but might,” Bartholomaus said. “With that knowledge, we can anticipate potential sea-level rise and set up the observational campaigns in advance to understand these glacier changes.” This new knowledge of glacier melt also will help scientists refine the models used to predict sea-level rise. </td>

This unique student group based in our College of Engineering recently returned from the SAE Clean Snowmobile Challenge in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. The students built a snowmobile modified for efficiency, decibel level and performance, completing a challenging 100-mile Endurance Run and coming home to Idaho with awards for Best Value and Best Acceleration. It’s one of the many exciting student-led projects you’ll find at our annual <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/engr/events/expo"" target=""_blank"">Engineering Design Expo</a>.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The longest-running student engineering expo of its kind in the Northwest, the Engineering Design Expo showcases the outstanding innovation and hands-on design work of our College of Engineering students. More than 275 University of Idaho engineering students participate with 40 technical presentations and 60 booth presentations. It’s a chance for graduating seniors to show off their <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/engr/events/expo/capstone"" target=""_blank"">capstone projects</a> in this hands-on degree program. Judges drawn from the ranks of important regional employers offer constructive criticism and feedback, and students also gain a sense of that connection to rewarding careers.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The Expo brings the Vandal engineering students of the future to campus. More than 500 K-12 students and students from North Idaho College and the College of Western Idaho will see firsthand what an <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/engr/events/expo/projects"" target=""_blank"">exciting and practical educational experience</a> looks like. Students are taking on innovative and thought-provoking work in everything from 3D metal printing to downtown Boise infrastructure to high-altitude balloon launches to flywheel energy storage. The applications for engineering are nearly limitless. I can’t wait for our prospective students to see the work and start imagining their projects as Vandals.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Engineering has long been a strength at the University of Idaho. We’ve gained a prominent reputation among our peers, among nationally known companies, and among up-and-coming organizations and ventures. UI was an early adopter and is now one of more than 100 institutions nationwide taking part in the National Academy of Engineering Grand Challenges Scholars Program, focusing on important areas, including one in which UI is very strong, cybersecurity. At Expo this year we have the honor of <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/engr/events/expo/keynote"" target=""_blank"">welcoming Brent Stacey</a>, a strategic advisor for the Idaho National Laboratory’s National and Homeland Security mission. This is an up-close window into the complex and vital task of protecting our energy infrastructure, in part through assuring cybersecurity.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Whether they want to <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/giving/engr/college-priorities/clean-snowmobile-team"" target=""_blank"">build a better snowmobile</a> <span class=""_Tgc"">—</span> check out the <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLMV6TKSK14&amp;feature=youtu.be']);"" href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLMV6TKSK14&amp;feature=youtu.be"" target=""_blank"">video below</a> to see some of that work in action, and think about joining up with the team, even if you’re not an engineering student <span class=""_Tgc"">—</span> or work in energy or water or any number of rewarding pursuits, Vandal engineers are in demand. They’ll be on the front lines of creating a sustainable, secure, healthier world we all can enjoy. </td>

The Jan and Dale Welch College of Engineering Scholarship will provide opportunities for high school graduates pursuing undergraduate engineering degrees. The Welches also provided resources for critical facility and equipment upgrades within the Department of Civil Engineering. The third portion goes to the Vandal Scholarship Fund and Athletics. Both from Boise, Jan and Dale met while pursuing degrees in Civil Engineering. Jan is now President of Stapley Engineering and Dale is former Engineering Leader for Idaho Power. With daughters Laura ’10 and Lise ’18 joining them in the Vandal family, Jan and Dale have been well served by their UI education and are passionate about supporting Idahoans interested in engineering careers. The College of Engineering is proud and grateful to claim Jan and Dale Welch as valued alumni and, with this estate gift, members of the Heritage Society.

This letter can’t capture the full range of ambition, creativity and dedication you’ll find among our nearly 12,000 students. But a few examples speak to <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/academic-affairs/distinguished-scholarships/recent-scholarship-recipients"" target=""_blank"">the energy and excellence</a> you’ll find at our great public research university.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> This year, UI has <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2017-march/032717-nsfrecipients"" target=""_blank"">three recipients of the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship</a>, highly coveted awards that facilitate advanced studies. Fewer than 2,000 NSF Graduate Research Fellowships are awarded each year. From Potlatch, Idaho, materials science and engineering student Isaac Curtis will use his award to begin a doctorate at UI. Benjamin Anzis of Marshalltown, Iowa, studying mathematics in our College of Science and already a Goldwater Scholar, plans to pursue his doctorate in algebraic geometry. Emily White, from Hawthorne, California, is a graduate student working on a doctorate in geology. Combined with six honorable mentions for this award, UI has had a significant presence in these awards for a university of our size <span class=""_Tgc"">—</span> testament to our students, our faculty mentors, and our program staff who all contribute to these opportunities.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Sponsored by the U.S. State Department and awarded to fewer than 3,000 students each year, the <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/bit.ly/2p7ZVLb']);"" href=""http://bit.ly/2p7ZVLb"" target=""_blank"">Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholarship</a> facilitates international scholarships and internships. This spring Casandra Clements, an elementary education major and a junior from Nampa, received a Gilman award to spend the semester in Verona, Italy, through the University Studies Abroad Consortium. Emma Scott, a senior majoring in anthropology from Texas, received a Gilman scholarship for the summer and will take part in a UI faculty-led program to Ghana, studying community, culture and musical traditions.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> I want to also congratulate <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2017-april/050417-fulbrights"" target=""_blank"">two Fulbright U.S. Student Award winners</a>. Our two recipients, Amaya Amigo and Mary Ortman, are actually recent graduates. Amigo was selected for a master in public administration program at SDA Bocconi in Italy. Ortman was selected for an English teaching assistantship in Croatia. A Fulbright is an impressive award that open doors on a resum&eacute;, but I am sure our Vandals are just as excited about the experiences they’ll have and the impact they will make.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Our Vandals have excelled in service and community-building, too. Through our <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/student-involvement/volunteer/asb"" target=""_blank"">Alternative Service Break program</a>, dozens of students volunteered overseas in places like Ecuador and The Philippines. More Vandals spent spring break on ASB trips in Oregon, in Washington, and right here in Idaho. I joined our new freshmen last fall in the <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/student-involvement/volunteer/service/sync"" target=""_blank"">Serving Your New Community (SYNC)</a> day of action, a kick-off to a Vandal career filled with volunteerism. That spirit infuses the activities calendar of our fraternity and sorority system, too. It’s a university-wide commitment that has earned UI a perennial spot on the <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2016-october/101216-volunteerism"" target=""_blank"">President’s Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll</a>, the highest such distinction in the country.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Whether in the classroom, in research and scholarship settings, or in the community, our Vandals have continued to shine. Congratulations to our students for fulfilling and renewing our tradition of excellence. </td>

Her own experience in the UI marching band informs Freeman’s understanding of the critical role of scholarships in supporting successful student-athletes and ensuring healthy university athletic programs. Vandal sports have earned 24 conference championship titles since 2010, and the program had 198 student-athletes with grade-point averages of 3.0 or better for the 2016 calendar year. A recent UI Law School graduate and current deputy prosecuting attorney in the Civil Division of the Ada County Prosecutor’s Office, Freeman now supports students through the VSF scholarship as she was once supported. Her vehicle for giving? The #VSF360 program. Launched in January 2017, the goal of the #VSF360 campaign is to engage 360 new Vandal Scholarship Fund donors, attracting first-time donors and young alumni to begin building a lifelong legacy.

That belief led Kempthorne to enroll as a pre-med major at the University of Idaho in the 1970s, though he switched his major to political science, and earned his bachelor’s degree from what is now the College of Letters, Arts and Social Sciences (CLASS) in 1975. This May, Kempthorne will return to UI and finally receive the title “doctor”: The university has <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/class/politics-and-philosophy/news-and-events/kempthorne"" target=""_blank"">awarded Kempthorne an Honorary Doctor of Administrative Science</a>. Kempthorne was nominated to be the 49th Secretary of the Interior in 2006 by President George W. Bush and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. In 2009, he stepped down from the Department of Interior and began a new phase of his career as president and CEO of the American Council of Life Insurers (ACLI) in 2010. He will receive the honor during the commencement ceremony May 13 in Moscow. </td>

Idaho entered the Big Sky Tournament as the No. 2 seed and defeated No. 3 Sacramento State 4-0 and then Montana to advance to the national tournament.

At UI commencements across the state this spring, I have had the chance to congratulate our talented and hard-working Vandals. This spring, UI has <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2017-april/042517-moscowcommencement"" target=""_blank"">added nearly 1,500 graduates</a> to our Vandal family.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Among those graduates are Reinaldo Gil Zambrano, Robert Stewart and Aly Mendiola:<br /> &nbsp;<br /> One brisk Saturday last October, I sat at the wheel of a small steamroller. Graduate student Reinaldo Gil Zambrano — who will receive his Master of Fine Arts on Saturday — put together a <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/caa/programs/art-design/featured-stories/steamroller"" target=""_blank"">printmaking showcase</a> that had artists from UI and several regional universities taking large, inked wood blocks, stretching colorful tapestry across them, and adhering the print with a steamroller. The resulting beautiful and unique artwork was a special exhibit of the talent and creativity of our Vandals. Our Vandal family includes students from nearly 80 countries, including Reinaldo, a native of Venezuela. <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/bit.ly/2qVr9tF']);"" href=""http://bit.ly/2qVr9tF"" target=""_blank"">Check out the video</a> about Reinaldo’s project at the bottom of the page, and join me in wishing him well as he steams his way to new challenges in the art world.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> In April, I had the chance to visit our Engineering Design Expo. Surveying the seniors’ capstone projects, I connected with <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/engr/news/features/robert-stewart"" target=""_blank"">computer science graduate Robert Stewart</a>, one of many engineering students whose Vandal experience is a springboard to exciting career opportunities. Now 19 years old, Robert had designed and launched his first app on the Apple App Store by age 11. At UI, the National Merit Scholar has helped our team prepare for the DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge, interned at Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories and at Apple, and is on his way to a job opportunity with Apple. I have no doubt we’ll see more from Robert, maybe without knowing it, as we use our phones or another life-changing piece of technology.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Let me give you one more example of the interesting paths our students take. I haven’t personally met <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/class/soc-anthro/students-and-alumni/aly"" target=""_blank"">graduating senior Aly Mendiola</a>, but her Vandal experience represents another important side of UI life. A sociology major from Boise, Aly has demonstrated a strong commitment to volunteering in the community. She’s worked extensively with a local food bank and through the Center for Volunteerism and Social Action. I’m glad this dedicated Vandal is going to stay in state as she goes to graduate school on her path to a career that emphasizes serving others.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Whether they are graduating in art, engineering, social work, or any number of disciplines from law to landscape architecture, I’m impressed every spring by the spirit and skills of our Vandal graduates. Thank you to the many alumni and friends who have supported our graduates on their way to success. We can all look forward to what they accomplish next. </td>

Last month, the Idaho Cattle Foundation recommended $65,950 be awarded to support work in beef nutrition and rangeland science across the state. One $20,000 grant will kick off up to $500,000 in matching support from both the Auen Foundation and the H.N. and Frances C. Berger Foundation. This pivotal funding will build an education center at the Nancy M. Cummings Research, Extension and Education Center in Salmon, housing a much-needed large classroom, as well as lab and conference space. “The College of Agricultural and Life Sciences is thankful for the continued relationship and support from the Idaho Cattle Foundation,” said Michael Parrella, dean of the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences (CALS). “These contributions allow us to broaden the impact of our research efforts across the state.” For more information on <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/giving/cals"" target=""_blank"">giving to CALS</a>, contact Eric Billings at 208-885-4038 or <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/email/mailto:ebillings@uidaho.edu']);"" href=""mailto:ebillings@uidaho.edu"" target=""_blank"">ebillings@uidaho.edu</a>. </td>

The program is funded through a three-year U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) grant the Women’s Center received in fall 2016. UI joins 13 other campuses that are participants in the Healthy Masculinity Campus Athletics Project (HMCAP), funded through the DOJ’s Office on Violence against Women Campus Technical Assistance and Resource Project. As part of the initiative, UI representatives from across campus will attend an intensive three-day training this summer emphasizing athletics’ leadership on social justice issues, and how male student-athletes, coaches and athletic administrators can model the prosocial norms of healthy masculinity to foster healthier and safer campuses. UI will begin implementing the Healthy Masculinity curriculum this fall, as well as develop an action plan that addresses both prevention and response strategies. </td>

David Vobora — former NFL linebacker, Vandal football great, and College of Letters, Arts and Social Sciences alumnus — gave an inspirational address. &quot;Don’t marginalize your own capabilities as a leader,&quot; he said. &quot;Don't take complacency. Don’t rest on your own intelligence or capabilities.&quot; I<span style=""color: #000000;""> c</span>an’t think of a better message to start our academic year.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Convocation is our academic kickoff, but next Friday we can come together for another kind of kickoff as our Vandal soccer team — the reigning Big Sky champions two years running — <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/www.govandals.com/news/2017/4/27/womens-soccer-vandals-kickof-20th-season-in-the-kibbie-dome.aspx']);"" href=""http://www.govandals.com/news/2017/4/27/womens-soccer-vandals-kickof-20th-season-in-the-kibbie-dome.aspx"" target=""_blank""> takes on Boise State University here in Moscow</a>. Vandal soccer has a new home in the Kibbie Dome, and the indoor field is unique in all of NCAA soccer. I’m excited about continuing the tradition of Vandal soccer success and building a vibrant culture around this team in this venue.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> With the potential for large and loud crowds, the Dome offers a distinct competitive advantage. I hope the Vandal family will join us in Moscow to make the most of that advantage. We will have a free and family-friendly <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/events/idaho-fan-zone"" target=""_blank"">Fan Zone experience</a> starting at 4 p.m. in the west end of the upper Kibbie parking lot with food, music and special giveaways. Join the fun and meet other Vandals — <em>and as a special offer open to Vandals and the broader community, at the pre-soccer Fan Zone you can pick up free tickets to the Aug. 31 football game when the Vandals take on Sacramento State</em>. The first 2,000 attendees will also receive their very own Vandal vuvuzela (say that one 10 times fast…).<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Why the Dome? A couple reasons. With Guy Wicks field prone to flooding, we needed to do something to make sure we never had important games washed away. Our football field was due for replacement, and we saw a chance to do something special. The Kibbie Dome offers a brand-new field, space for crowds, availability of concessions and a vibrant atmosphere. Coach Derek Pittman and our student-athletes on the soccer team are excited about the move and ready to compete for more championships on the turf.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> I hope as many of you as possible join us to see the kick off to that journey. (The match will <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/www.govandals.com/sports/2016/7/8/watch-big-sky.aspx']);"" href=""http://www.govandals.com/sports/2016/7/8/watch-big-sky.aspx"" target=""_blank"">also be live-streamed</a> for those rooting from afar.) Come out and contribute to a fun and festive environment as we take on the squad from down south. Welcome to fall 2017 — see you at the match! </td>

This success would not be possible without the continuing support of Mark Tidd, TitleOne CEO and former UI student-athlete, and the TitleOne Corporation, the presenting sponsor of this signature event for the past five years. Their contribution of $50,000 takes the event to new heights and inspires others to give back. “Receiving an athletic scholarship at the University of Idaho changed my life,” Tidd said. “I wouldn’t have been able to afford to go to school otherwise.” Mark’s commitment means the VSF will continue to change the lives of Vandal student-athletes.

The grant, awarded to Associate Professor F. Marty Ytreberg in the Department of Physics in UI’s College of Science, is among eight projects totaling $41.7 million awarded through the NSF’s Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) Program. Ytreberg’s project, &quot;Using biophysical protein models to map genetic variation to phenotypes,” will use computer simulations, mathematical modeling and experiments to determine how amino acid changes modify the way that proteins interact with other molecules. Ytreberg’s project includes a team of scientists and students at UI, the University of Vermont and Brown University. The results, expected to be released on an ongoing basis beginning in spring 2018, will be shared with the public via interactive animations, a website for dissemination of results and presentations for diverse audiences in all three states.<br /> &nbsp; </td>

Our state’s national research university is poised to deliver on the ambitious <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/provost/strategic-plan"" target=""_blank"">Strategic Plan</a> goals we laid out last year. A united effort from students, faculty and staff, as well as our alumni and friends, is the key to achieving progress.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Our first goal is to “Innovate” — to conduct research, scholarship and creative activity that makes an impact on Idaho and beyond. Among other performance measures, we are ramping up our research expenditures, invention disclosures, and student participation in research and sponsored projects. You may have seen physics professor’s <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2017-august/080317-epscorgrant"" target=""_blank"">Marty Ytreberg’s recent $6 million grant</a> from the National Science Foundation to study amino acids, and you may have heard that we have surpassed $102 million in annual research expenditures. We will keep building on our land-grant strengths and focusing on emerging areas of excellence.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The University of Idaho also seeks to “Engage” with outreach that inspires innovation and improves Idaho. Our impact on Idaho's go-on rate is a key performance measure — how many more students are we bringing in to the life-changing experience of a Vandal education? We gained ground on that goal last year, thanks to programs such as Direct Admissions, and we continue to award <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2017-august/081617-scholarshipawards"" target=""_blank"">more than $25 million annually</a> in financial aid — the most in the state — to help students make college a reality. This fall we’ve focused our <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/research/faculty/find-funding/internal-funding/vandal-ideas-project/2017-vip-recipients"" target=""_blank"">VIP grant project on the “Engage” goal</a>, with innovative projects that connect with communities and promote college-going. By thinking outside the box in policies and practices, we have positioned UI to grow. Every member of our staff, each student, and our loyal alumni can all serve as ambassadors in our effort to improve Idaho’s educational attainment.&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;<br /> We want to bring more students to UI because we believe in our capacity to “Transform” their lives through a unique educational experience. We don’t just want students to attend UI, we want them to graduate and to take their places as engaged, successful citizens. This year our new <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/faculty-staff-news/2017-january/011317-studentsuccessinitiative"" target=""_blank"">Student Success Initiative</a> provides <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/sem/sem-departments"" target=""_blank"">a comprehensive approach</a> to academic advising, student support and Career Services. I am confident we will build on our enrollment, as well as our retention and graduation rates, which already lead among public institutions in Idaho.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Finally, UI must continue to “Cultivate” a diverse and valued community. Multicultural and international students, faculty and staff are part of the history and bright future of this global-facing institution. That emphasis benefits our statewide campus — and our state. We also need to ensure that this institution is a great place to build a career. We’ve implemented a rigorous <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/provost/updates"" target=""_blank"">program prioritization effort</a> to make sure we’re allocating resources to support strategic goals. It’s a challenging process, but increased wages and more support for our teaching assistants are outcomes that will strengthen UI for the long haul.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Alumni and friends have a critical role in the success I’ve described. I ask you to stay informed, stay engaged, and stay motivated to help this institution be its best.<br /> &nbsp; </td>

Today’s medical teaching methods call for flexible, small-group learning spaces wired for current technology requirements. The WWAMI building renovation seamlessly combines the latest technologies in medical learning and discovery with additional space essential for academic and clinical faculty. These critical updates emphasize current educational trends and enhanced patient care techniques. “We are glad to collaborate with the Idaho WWAMI program because it is very important to the care of the residents of our region and the education of great physicians to care for those residents,” said Dr. David Pate, St. Luke’s president and CEO. “St. Luke’s, our staff and our patients have a true stake in retaining physicians with direct experience in Idaho who will go on to practice in vital and needed areas, including primary and rural care.” For more information on supporting the Idaho WWAMI Medical Education Program and partnering with UI, contact Chloe Rambo in Corporate and Foundation Relations at 208-885-7060 or <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/email/mailto:crambo@uidaho.edu']);"" href=""mailto:crambo@uidaho.edu"" target=""_blank"">crambo@uidaho.edu</a>. </td>

The College of Law could not be more proud to be the statewide leader in legal education in Idaho.” Previously, all students completed their first-year in Moscow and then could transition to Boise, if desired, for their second and third year. The addition of first-year classes in Boise makes a Juris Doctor degree fully available at either location. Classes in Boise are held in the&nbsp;Idaho Law and Justice Learning Center&nbsp;(ILJLC), in the renovated historic Ada County Courthouse in the heart of downtown Boise. The ILJLC also houses the Idaho State Law Library and the Idaho Supreme Court’s judicial education offices. It is adjacent to the Idaho Supreme Court, Idaho State&nbsp;Bar&nbsp;and the Capitol Building. </td>

For any parent, it’s a time filled with excitement and pride. You want your child to dive into academic life, take on new challenges, and expand his or her world. That exploration can come with concerns. It’s natural: You want your child to be safe.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Let me state clearly up front: No college campus is immune to accidents or unfortunate events. These are large, multifaceted institutions. That said, we work very hard to cultivate a culture of safety, starting from the time students arrive on campus. All new full-time students are required to complete the interactive <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/orientation/think-about-it"" target=""_blank"">“Think About It”</a> orientation, which examines relationships, substance abuse and violence. That bolsters the discussions students have with Student Life leaders on campus.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> We also focus on safety during our annual Safety Week, which starts Sunday, Sept. 10. The week promotes a culture of safety and asks the Vandal family to proactively look out for one another. The annual <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/diversity/dhr/womens-center/events/take-back-the-night"" target=""_blank"">“Take Back the Night”</a> rally, a partnership between the Women's Center and the Violence Prevention Programs at UI, is Sept. 14. Mary Beth is looking forward to attending again and raising awareness about interpersonal violence and support for those affected. The annual Katy Benoit Safety Forum also takes place on Sept. 14.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Our Violence Prevention Programs include the <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/student-affairs/dean-of-students/violence-prevention/green-dot/sign-up"" target=""_blank"">“Green Dot” campaign</a>, which offers bystander intervention training. The <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/vandal-health-education/events/i-got-your-back"" target=""_blank"">“I Got Your Back” campaign</a>, a series of trainings, events and resources, amplifies that message throughout the year: speak out, get involved, look out for one another. Last year the Women's Center was awarded a <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2016-october/101016-womenscentergrant"" target=""_blank"">$300,000 grant</a> from the U.S. Department of Justice for a multi-year <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/cvpp"" target=""_blank"">Campus Violence Prevention Project</a>; our Vandal Athletics program <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2017-may/050217-womenscenter"" target=""_blank"">is joining that effort</a> to engage male student-athletes, coaches and administrators in addressing interpersonal violence&nbsp; and sexual assault. I am proud of this institution-wide commitment. In addition, this year a number of campus entities — the UI <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/ctc"" target=""_blank"">Counseling &amp; Testing Center</a>, <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/www.betathetapiuniversityofidaho.com']);"" href=""http://www.betathetapiuniversityofidaho.com/"" target=""_blank"">Beta Theta Pi fraternity</a>, <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/campus-recreation"" target=""_blank"">Campus Recreation</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/vandal-health-education"" target=""_blank"">Vandal Health Education</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/orgsync.com/144118/chapter']);"" href=""https://orgsync.com/144118/chapter"" target=""_blank"">To Write Love On Her Arms WSU</a> — have come together to host the second annual <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/campus-recreation/events/5k"" target=""_blank"">“We Got Your Back” Suicide Awareness 5K</a> on Sept. 12.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Proactive involvement when others are facing danger or other challenges is central to our approach as a campus community. We look out for each other. We educate ourselves and others. We speak up, we get involved. We are a Vandal family.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Despite our best efforts, we may face a difficult situation. I hope we will approach any problems in the same spirit with which we prepare for safety — as a Vandal family committed to the safety and well-being of each other. That is how we honor the promise we make at move-in day and every day at UI. </td>

Barbara ’85 and Anthony &quot;Tony&quot; Tesnohlidek ’85, surgeon and anesthesiologist, respectively, provided a transformational leadership gift for the <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/academics/wwami"" target=""_blank"">WWAMI medical education program</a> facility near the University of Idaho campus in Moscow. “The WWAMI program is dedicated to providing high-quality instruction,” explained Tony. “We have been practicing medicine in southwestern Idaho for the past 23 years and feel a need to give back to the program that contributed so much to our professional development.” The $7 million WWAMI facility remodel is scheduled for completion in early 2018. The remodel will result in a technology-rich center with updated simulation and anatomy labs that facilitate collaborative learning. “Offering students the best medical education and facilities will ensure these future doctors will be prepared for an exceptional medical experience,&quot; said Jeff Seegmiller, director of the WWAMI Medical Education Program. “We are very grateful to the Tesnohlideks for their generosity and support.” For information on giving to the University of Idaho WWAMI program, contact Jim Zuba at 208-885-4142 or <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/email/mailto:jzuba@uidaho.edu']);"" href=""mailto:jzuba@uidaho.edu"" target=""_blank"">jzuba@uidaho.edu</a>. </td>

The annual award recognizes an outstanding member of the library profession who has made significant contributions to their library and communities. “Librarianship is a profession dedicated to helping, educating and assisting people as they navigate an increasingly complex world of data, information and media,” Hunter said. “I love being able to make a difference in people’s lives.” To qualify for ILA’s Librarian of the Year, nominees must have a strong commitment to Idaho libraries; demonstrate leadership qualities in librarianship values, cooperative and collaborative activities; participate in mentoring and in-service training for librarians; and participate in a special library service project. Recent UI Library-specific projects that Hunter participated in include co-managing the library’s $1.3 million first-floor remodel, developing a comprehensive library student worker training program, and the reorganization of library services to support researchers and increase the impact on overall student success at the university. </td>

A three-time Olympic gold medalist comes back to Moscow Saturday as we dedicate the Kristin Armstrong Paradise Path. This new name for a well-loved bicycle path crossing the Moscow campus celebrates a legacy of excellence and offers a reminder to Vandals to always give it your best on the way to the finish line.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> A quick reminder of Kristin Armstrong Savola's story: When the 2016 Summer Olympics rolled around, Kristin didn’t have to compete. She was retired, after all, having already won a pair of gold medals and two world championships in cycling. She has a family. She has philanthropic and professional commitments in the Boise community. But the spirit of competition called, and there she was, back on a bicycle, the oldest racer in the cycling time trials, battling a bloody nose, the rain and a shortened training period to <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/www.spokesman.com/stories/2016/aug/10/idaho-grad-kristin-armstrong-wins-gold-in-cycling-/']);"" href=""http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2016/aug/10/idaho-grad-kristin-armstrong-wins-gold-in-cycling-/"" target=""_blank"">charge from behind for victory</a>. It was a thrill to see one of our own on the medal stand.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Kristin is a <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/ed/news-and-features/armstrong-bike-path/balance"" target=""_blank"">1995 graduate of the University of Idaho</a>. She was on the UI track team and completed a degree in exercise physiology <span class=""st"">—</span> an example of the diversity of disciplines in our newly renamed College of Education, Health and Human Sciences <span class=""st"">—</span> before starting the Olympic journey that took her to Athens and to gold medals in Beijing, London and Rio.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Last month, Kristin <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/www.usatoday.com/story/sports/cycling/2017/08/28/kristin-armstrong-joins-usa-cyclings-endurance-program/105056482/']);"" href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/cycling/2017/08/28/kristin-armstrong-joins-usa-cyclings-endurance-program/105056482/"" target=""_blank"">joined the USA Cycling program as an endurance performance director</a>, part of a lifelong commitment to health, well-being and athletic excellence. Kristin has been a loyal and supportive Vandal throughout her post-graduation life, receiving our Distinguished Idahoan award in 2015 and serving as an advisor to the College of Education, Health and Human Sciences. We are so proud to welcome her back.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The Palouse and North Idaho are excellent places for biking. It’s always a great weekend when I have the chance to take the Latah Trail from Moscow to Troy, working to improve my times, even as more practiced riders show me what’s possible. The Bill Chipman Trail out to Pullman is an enjoyable day trip for solo riders, student groups or families. Elsewhere in North Idaho, the Trail of the Coeur d’Alenes and the Route of the Hiawatha Bike Trail offer glimpses of our beautiful state that can’t be found any other way. I’ve had the chance to participate in Ride Idaho several times, too, connecting with fellow Vandals along the way <span class=""st"">—</span> a nice way to get to know people, as well as our land.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> It’s a fitting tribute to that bicycling culture and tradition that we imprint Kristin Armstrong’s name on a part of it. I know many students are looking to explore Idaho on their bicycle. As Vandals, they’re also exploring in a different sense <span class=""st"">—</span> what disciplines they’re excited about, what interests motivate them, what they want to contribute to the world. Seeing the Armstrong name so prominently on campus should be a good reminder to keep exploring <span class=""st"">—</span> to go for the gold.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2017-september/090617-armstrongchange"" target=""_blank"">Join us tomorrow for the dedication</a> with Kristin in the afternoon at the Fan Zone, before we head over to cheer on our undefeated Vandal football team as they take on UNLV in the Dome. See you on there <span class=""st"">—</span> and on the trail!<br /> &nbsp; </td>

The College Assistance Migrant Program (CAMP) program tailored the experience for Hispanic students. That meant a lot to me.” While attending UI, Gonzalez sought activities — ASUI, the Center for Volunteerism, the Movimiento Activista Social student organization, and a study abroad experience in Cuba — that helped her identify her passion for contributing to positive change. She continues to support meaningful student programming as an alumna, choosing to give to the new Weekend ASB initiative sponsored by the Alternative Service Break (ASB) program. Weekend ASB engages students who want to immerse themselves in service, but cannot commit, due to time or financial constraints, to a full winter or spring break trip.

The college is <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2017-august/090117-collegeofed"" target=""_blank"">now known as the&nbsp;College of Education, Health and Human Sciences</a>. Adding health and human sciences highlights the programs offered by the college outside of teacher education, such as movement sciences, athletic training, tourism, dance, recreation, exercise science, counseling, rehabilitation and community health. Established as an independent unit of the university in 1920, the college serves more than 1,000 students each year in six bachelor’s degree programs, nine master’s degree programs and three doctorate programs. The college is Idaho’s premier institution for teacher preparation, as well as programs that promote a healthy active lifestyle. The College of Education, Health and Human Sciences’ name change further reflects the transformation the college has seen over the past year with the completion of a $19 million renovation to its building. </td>

We try to offer the best information possible about our institution’s combination of academic quality, affordability and unique opportunities. We think UI stands out on those measures; but of course, the president would say that. So third-party sources offer an entry point into objectively comparing institutions and understanding the value each offers.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> This week saw the release of the annual <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/www.usnews.com/best-colleges/university-of-idaho-1626']);"" href=""https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/university-of-idaho-1626"" target=""_blank"">U.S. News and World Report rankings, with UI the No. 90 “Top Public School” in the country</a>. UI ranks No. 171 among national universities overall. Our business and engineering programs are singled out for their excellence.<br /> <br /> When looking at rankings, I encourage students and families to look at how the methodology views factors like affordability and access, as well as the actual student experience <span class=""st"">—</span> educational quality, meaningful programs, service and scholarship and professional opportunities. How are outcomes such as graduation rates and alumni earnings considered? Does the ranking system match the institutional mission? For example, the U.S. News and World Report methodology rewards selectivity <span class=""st"">—</span> how many qualified students are turned away. That doesn’t reflect our priorities at UI. As a public institution, we want to offer all qualified students an opportunity to pursue their dreams. We are an excellent institution because we hold the door open.<br /> <br /> UI stands out among its peers in the Washington Monthly rankings: <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/washingtonmonthly.com/2017college-guide?ranking=2017-rankings-national-universities']);"" href=""http://washingtonmonthly.com/2017college-guide?ranking=2017-rankings-national-universities"" target=""_blank"">We moved up 17 spots this year to No. 67</a> among national universities.

The site has a tool to quickly build comparisons between institutions. Try it out <span class=""st"">—</span> I’m confident UI shines in those comparisons.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> As I’ve said before, not all rankings are created equal.

The study will focus on three closely related antelopes that differ considerably in body size: bushbuck, nyala and kudu. In the wild, availability of resources such as food, water and shelter fluctuates constantly. Animals must adjust their behavior in response to changing environmental conditions in order to survive and reproduce. Data gathered during this project will help researchers understand how variation in body size limits animals’ ability to respond to changes in the environment, such as the availability of food or water. While the information gathered will be important for determining the best conservation and management practices in Gorongosa, it could also be useful for understanding North American species of varying sizes, such as deer, elk and moose. </td>

Recipients of the competitive fellowships have their tuition and fees covered by their university during their first years of graduate school (years one to three) and their tuition and fees plus a $60,000 annual salary paid by INL during the last two years of their doctoral research performed at the lab. The program allows INL to integrate students into the laboratory and provides graduate fellows with work on significant projects that will help them fulfill their thesis research requirements. INL gains access to skilled staff, along with the opportunity to build long-term collaborations with universities, increase recruiting opportunities, and interact with a continuous pipeline of students interning and conducting research at the lab. Both the university and INL have the opportunity for joint publications and intellectual property. Graduate fellows were selected in degree fields that closely tie to INL’s three mission areas of innovative nuclear energy solutions, other clean energy options and critical infrastructure. </td>

Idaho’s low college-going rate represents enormous untapped potential — a pool of enterprising talent needed for the state’s growing 21st century economy. We are trying to lower each and every hurdle to get more students to the starting gate of a college education.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The State Board is introducing the next evolution of that effort, the <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/nextsteps.idaho.gov/resources/apply-idaho/']);"" href=""https://nextsteps.idaho.gov/resources/apply-idaho/"" target=""_blank"">Apply Idaho common application</a>. This tool allows students to apply for Idaho public colleges and universities, including UI, through one central pathway. A minimum of information is required from the student at the time of completion, and there are just four simple steps. You don’t have to know your major, and you don’t have to pay an application fee. The program even has a tool to do a quick check for scholarships (UI follows that up with comprehensive scholarship information).<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Apply Idaho builds on the simplicity introduced by the Direct Admissions program. That program lets public high school students know that they are qualified based on their academic achievement and have been admitted. This year's letters to parents and students will soon be arriving in mailboxes, a vote of confidence in our young people, telling them we know they can achieve at the next level because they’ve already shown they are qualified and prepared.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Of course, UI is a multifaceted institution, and students come to us <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/admissions/Apply/transfer"" target=""_blank"">as transfers</a>, as adult learners, as <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/admissions/graduate"" target=""_blank"">graduate students</a>, as <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/financial-aid/scholarships/out-of-state"" target=""_blank"">out-of-state students</a> and as <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/admissions/international"" target=""_blank"">international students</a>. We are a comprehensive, national research university, and we hold the door open for students of all types and from all places and backgrounds, believing that we offer an unparalleled experience and essential preparation for each student. With that context, bringing more Idaho undergraduates to college has been a driving focus, and will continue to be. I hope our <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/alumni/get-involved/vandals-in-partnership/"" target=""_blank"">alumni and friends</a> will continue to get the word out about programs that can impact the future of our young people in Idaho and beyond.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> There is no one silver bullet to bringing more people into the higher education experience. On the level of policy and practices, we have to continue to think critically about our existing ways of doing things, experiment judiciously with new ideas, and wisely implement solutions. We also have to continue to communicate the value of postsecondary education. You’re going to keep hearing me <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/engr/news/features/selso-gallegos"" target=""_blank"">tout success stories</a>, talk about <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/www.payscale.com/career-news/2017/08/best-4-year-colleges-in-every-state']);"" href=""https://www.payscale.com/career-news/2017/08/best-4-year-colleges-in-every-state"" target=""_blank"">return on investment</a>, and advocate for solutions that <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/research/faculty/find-funding/internal-funding/vandal-ideas-project"" target=""_blank"">help Idaho’s higher education pipeline</a>.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Lastly, a word about financial aid, another step future Vandals will need to take. Last year, UI allowed students and families to complete the FAFSA in October to apply for aid for the following fall. We moved our financial aid priority date to December, letting more students learn their scholarship and aid package sooner. We felt then, as we do now, that going to college is a big decision — you should have all the financial facts as early as possible. We are very confident that the facts speak well for UI, based on price and based on the <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/financial-aid/scholarships"" target=""_blank"">$25 million in annual financial aid we award</a> — a life-changing educational experience at a leading research university, for an affordable price.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> That’s a value proposition we truly believe in here at UI. I am glad that the application and admissions process for students to access that excellence now has one more hurdle lowered.<br /> &nbsp; </td>

Tournaments will be held at the 5,300-seat CenturyLink Arena downtown. “Obviously I'm very excited for it to be in Boise because that's where the University of Idaho's biggest alumni base is,” said Don Verlin, UI head men's basketball coach. &nbsp;“I'm just excited for the state of Idaho and the city of Boise that we can be able to host this event.” Women’s basketball coach Jon Newlee said, “There is a huge population of Vandal alumni and fans down there. I know they are just going to come out and support us like crazy.” UI men and women will play a game in Boise this season as well, with a December 21 doubleheader at CenturyLink Arena that sees the women take on Eastern Oregon at 5 p.m. Mountain and the men follow against UC Irvine. The 2018 tournament will take place March 11-16 in Reno to complete that three-year agreement. Idaho is one of three Big Sky schools to have its men's and women's teams earn at least one victory in both seasons the tournament has been in Reno. </td>

With the John and Barbara Foltz CALS Ambassador Endowment, their impact will be felt for generations to come in the <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/cals/about/our-people/ambassadors"" target=""_blank"">CALS Ambassadors program</a>, which provides students an opportunity to gain leadership skills while promoting higher education to high school students. Impacting over 2,000 students through his years teaching in CALS before serving as the Associate Dean of Academic Programs and then Dean of the college, John recently accepted a position as Chair of the Animal Sciences Department at Ohio State University. “We are so grateful for John’s service as Associate Dean and Dean of CALS and for Barbara’s service with the Social Science Research Unit in the Agricultural Economics and Rural Sociology Department, and for the support that they have shown to the ambassador program through their endowment,” said Michael Parrella, CALS Dean. “This fund will enhance our recruitment efforts, promoting the benefits of higher education in the state and beyond.” For more information on how to support this endowment or the <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/giving/cals"" target=""_blank"">College of Agricultural and Life Sciences</a>, contact Jen Root at <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/email/mailto:jroot@uidaho.edu']);"" href=""mailto:jroot@uidaho.edu"" target=""_blank"">jroot@uidaho.edu</a> or 208-885-4087. </td>

Classes hadn’t yet started. Thanks to the Hatch Act, though, a dairy was up and running on campus, part of the just-established Idaho Agricultural Experiment Station. As Rafe Gibbs describes in &quot;Beacon for Mountain and Plain,&quot; while interviewing an applicant for Latin and Greek studies, the president realized he might be able to attach funding to the Hatch Act. Would the professor mind, between his instruction on Homer and Virgil, milking the cows?<br /> &nbsp;<br /> During this year's Homecoming weekend, we're also celebrating Idaho Agriculture or “Ag Days” weekend, and it's the 125th anniversary of the <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/cals/idaho-agricultural-experiment-station"" target=""_blank"">Idaho Agricultural Experiment Station</a>. The IAES is the statewide research division for UI’s agricultural research, conducted at nine research and Extension centers and three affiliated centers. If you live in Idaho, chances are good that there is a hub of innovation and expertise near you.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Our agricultural teaching, research and outreach mission is rooted in the past but squarely aimed at the future. Look at our <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/cals/nuclear-seed-potato-program"" target=""_blank"">nuclear seed potato program</a>, which helps the state of Idaho cultivate its signature tuber while educating and training students for rewarding careers. We’re also working hard on the Center for Agriculture, Food and the Environment (CAFE), which when completed will be the nation’s largest research dairy, at the forefront of research on food production and processing.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Tonight we’re proud to welcome to<a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/cals/celebrating-ag"" target=""_blank""> Celebrating Idaho Agriculture weekend</a> Sonny Ramaswamy, the <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/cals/news-and-events/speaker-series"" target=""_blank"">director of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture</a>, delivering a talk on “Innovations for 21st Century Food Systems.” Our College of Agricultural and Life Sciences has a variety of other events planned, as well as <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/cals/ag-days"" target=""_blank"">workshops for high school students</a>. Of course, we’re all looking forward to the pre-game barbecue, leading up to the homecoming football game.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/events/signature-events/homecoming"" target=""_blank"">Homecoming is an exciting week</a> for students and for alumni. A personal favorite event is the serpentine, which winds across campus on the way to the bonfire, a classic tradition that really shines here at the best residential college in Idaho. We’re also looking forward to the parade and seeing what people come up with for the “Under the Big Top” theme.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> For returning alumni, I know you’ll be struck by what has stayed the same since your college experience, as well as the many ways in which the university is moving forward. In that respect, it’s fitting that agriculture comes together with homecoming this weekend; our agricultural endeavors exemplify the best of our teaching, research and outreach mission, and prove how our past informs our future.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> We still haven’t found a professor to milk the cows while teaching the classics, at least to my knowledge. But we have grown and thrived as a home for agricultural excellence over these 125 years.<br /> &nbsp; </td>

Accomplished professional musicians with a major symphony orchestra, the Baileys honor their family history by generously supporting several family endowments. Most recently, they honored Bruce’s late mother, a 1934 Department of English alumna, through establishing the Mary Axtell Bailey Journalism Scholarship Endowment. “We created this scholarship in our mother’s memory because like others in our family, mom understood the value of hard work and a good education,” Bruce explained. “We want to help make that possible for the next generation because we deeply value the role the humanities and performing arts play in society and higher education.” For more information on <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/giving/class"" target=""_blank"">giving to the College of Letters, Arts and Social Sciences</a>, contact Shyanne Knighten at 208-885-4561 or <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/email/mailto:sknighten@uidaho.edu']);"" href=""mailto:sknighten@uidaho.edu"" target=""_blank"">sknighten@uidaho.edu</a>. </td>

This year’s update adds a more sophisticated “compare” function, allowing users to select institutions from the search results and view a more detailed, highly visual analysis. “The College Scorecard is an objective tool that measures the things students and families care about: affordability, student success, and return on investment after college,” said President Chuck Staben. “We’re very confident that the University of Idaho stands out as an exceptional value – an outstanding education at an affordable price, leading to career success.” </td>

The publication offers an inside look “behind all areas of the music business” and an annual special report “for readers who are thinking about continuing their music studies in college.” The Lionel Hampton School of Music is a close-knit community of prominent performers, teachers, composers and scholars who interact closely with dedicated and talented students. The school provides a learning environment in which students learn by performing, listening, analyzing and creating music in an atmosphere of professional awareness, mutual support, collaboration and outreach. The school advances the art of music through hundreds of concerts and recitals each year and is an accredited member of the National Association of Schools of Music. </td>

The anniversary is an opportunity to take pride in 100 years of excellence in education, research and statewide outreach. But while we celebrate our past accomplishments, we are also looking toward the future of this vital piece of our land-grant research university mission.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The college is a leader in natural resources education in the West, recently recognized among the top 5 percent of natural resource and conservation colleges. The college partners with industry on educational programs that prepare students to emerge with their degree armed with hands-on experience in their fields. The state’s forests, rangelands and waterways have been well-served by generations of highly skilled and motivated Vandals. We’re happy to welcome many of them back to Moscow this weekend to celebrate “100 Years of Leadership.”<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Research and scholarship are also CNR strengths. Vital research and outreach through the Forest Utilization Research (FUR) Programs includes the <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/cnr/policy-analysis-group"" target=""_blank"">Policy Analysis Group</a>, which provides analysis on natural resource issues; our <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/cnr/center-for-forest-nursery-and-seedling-research"" target=""_blank"">Center for Forest Nursery and Seedling Research</a>, a global leader in native plant regeneration education and research; the <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/cnr/ui-experimental-forest"" target=""_blank"">UI Experimental Forest</a>, which provides a working forest classroom; and the <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/cnr/rangeland-center"" target=""_blank"">UI Rangeland Center</a> collaboration between CNR and the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences, which uses science to find long-term solutions for managing rangelands. Through the college, UI provides unbiased research that helps deliver effective private and public management of our natural resources.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> CNR is also an arm for UI’s outreach mission. One needs look no further than the <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/cnr/mccall-outdoor-science-school/"" target=""_blank"">McCall Outdoor Science School</a> at our McCall Field Campus. To date, over 30,000 K-12 students have now gone through the program, an immersive experience that equips students with a new understanding of ecology and the exciting world of scientific exploration. Those STEM experiences engage curiosity and build character — they can be truly life-changing.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Lastly, CNR has a special connection to <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/giving/athletics/idaho-arena"" target=""_blank"">our Idaho Arena project</a>. Right now in the United States, we have the potential for a breakthrough in mass timber construction – projects that extensively use one or more kinds of engineered wood. Idaho, and the University of Idaho, are positioned to be leaders in this fast-emerging industry, with the arena a milestone in its development. Using mass-timber construction means opportunities for the college to engage partners, to train students in a real-world project, and to study research questions. Before we ever score a basket in the arena, we’ll already have won a major victory in research and economic development in a potentially game-changing Idaho industry.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> That’s an exciting future for UI, and a piece of it belongs to the College of Natural Resources. We appreciate the leadership role of the college throughout a century of teaching, innovation and statewide engagement. Here’s looking forward to the next century.<br /> &nbsp; </td>

Such is the legacy of this CNR professor, who devoted 38 years to sharing his tremendous enthusiasm for teaching with thousands of students. A strong proponent of experiential education and “real life” applications of learning, Fred and his family spent much of their time on the McCall Field Campus; to many, “Fred Johnson” and “summer camp” are synonymous. Fred’s legacy of great teaching lives on through the Fred Johnson Endowment for Teaching Excellence in Forest Resources, which recently reached $60,000 thanks to recent gifts by the Johnson family and fellow supporters. Fred’s advice to students: “Find something you love to do,&nbsp;then&nbsp;do it with passion.” For more information about this endowment or <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/giving/cnr"" target=""_blank"">other opportunities to support CNR</a>, contact Jennifer Farnum at 208-885-5145 or <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/email/mailto:jfarnum@uidaho.edu']);"" href=""mailto:jfarnum@uidaho.edu"" target=""_blank"">jfarnum@uidaho.edu</a>. </td>

The institute's goal is to spread knowledge about the Chinese language and culture. &quot;As you know, the English language and the Chinese language are two very different languages. The pronunciation is different, the spelling is different and the grammar is different,&quot; Xue (pronounced sh UH eh) said. &quot;There has been, for a very long time, an assumption among the people, particularly among the community around us, that it is very hard to acquire the language.&quot; To combat this assumption, the Confucius Institute holds community Chinese language classes in Moscow, Coeur d'Alene and Boise. In Moscow, the classes consist of two levels of Mandarin, each only $50 for the fall, and a Chinese calligraphy class at only $25. They're held Monday through Thursday in the Moscow Chamber of Commerce office. <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/media-coverage/2017-fall/101017-chineseculture"" target=""_blank""><em>READ MORE</em></a> </td>

Members of the Vandal Marching Band begin moving into formation. They form the iconic letter ‘I,’ set their sunglasses down on the field, and the props begin flashing in a dizzying display of lights. When the band members go on to form the Vandals script, the ‘I’ is still illuminated in the middle of the turf. The crowd erupts in cheers at the unanticipated light show, and then sings along as the UI fight song resonates throughout the Kibbie Dome. This innovative performance is the product of a partnership between the Department of Computer Science in the College of Engineering and UI’s marching band — an effort that began in 2012 when Bob Rinker, associate professor of computer science, and Athletic Band Director Spencer Martin met at the behest of student Josh Armstrong. <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/engr/news/features/sunglasses"" target=""_blank""><em>READ MORE</em></a> </td>

That commitment takes many forms and directions, offering many opportunities for engagement and enrichment. It has been an exciting couple of weeks in U of I efforts to strengthen our public dialogue.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Next Monday we’ll have a lecture from Carol Tavris, co-author of <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/class/general-education/common-read"" target=""_blank"">this year’s Common Read selection, “Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me),”</a> which describes the concept and the dangers of cognitive dissonance, the roles of self-justification in that behavior, and approaches to getting past that. The Common Read unites our university community, including our first-year students, in an intellectual exercise that sets a tone for engagement and inquiry. This year the <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/alumni/get-involved/vandal-book-club"" target=""_blank"">new Vandal Book Club</a> adopted “Mistakes Were Made” as its first book, a nice extension of this program to our alumni. I hope they’ve shared the interest and enthusiasm in this book that our campus community has shown.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> This week we were honored to have <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/class/borah/fall"" target=""_blank"">Nobel Prize laureate Dr. Shirin Ebadi</a> at our annual <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/class/borah"" target=""_blank"">Borah Symposium</a>. Ebadi, the first woman to hold the post of chief magistrate of a court in Tehran, Iran, before the Islamic Revolution, has been a strong voice for human rights and justice in the years following the revolution. Her keynote was a highlight in a robust program that also included presentations by Professor LeRoy Ashby and Scott Shapiro.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Finally, a little over a week ago our annual <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/law/news/bellwood"" target=""_blank"">Sherman J. Bellwood Lecture</a> brought <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/www.uiargonaut.com/2017/10/16/nevertheless-i-persisted-anita-hill-discusses-the-importance-of-data-at-ui-bellwood-lecture-wednesday']);"" href=""https://www.uiargonaut.com/2017/10/16/nevertheless-i-persisted-anita-hill-discusses-the-importance-of-data-at-ui-bellwood-lecture-wednesday"" target=""_blank"">Professor Anita Hill to Boise and to Moscow</a>. Many people may remember her launch into the public spotlight at the 1991 Supreme Court confirmation hearings for now-Justice Clarence Thomas. We were proud to host such a thoughtful and spirited examination of the role of evidence and accountability in policy, especially as it applies to issues such as civil rights and harassment.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Exploring ideas, policies and controversies in the public sphere is part of U of I’s commitment to helping our society understand the past, engage with the issues of the day and take on the challenges of tomorrow. Programs such as our Common Read, Borah Symposium and Bellwood Lecture provoke thought, spark dialogue and encourage new perspectives while promoting shared understanding. Engaging in these kind of programs, we grow as citizens and leaders. We develop a fuller appreciation for the challenges and opportunities ahead of us. </td>

As he and a friend from the school’s soccer team made their way through the store, they paused in the television section, where every TV was tuned to the same program: a replay of the Vandals’ December appearance in the Famous Idaho Potato Bowl, a 61–50 win over Colorado State. Sannon, a fifth-year senior, was incredulous as he watched his second touchdown of the day, a 16-yard catch in the game’s third quarter, unfold on dozens of screens. “It’s six months since our bowl game, and they’ve still got it on the TV,” he recalls, still amazed 48 hours later. After playing on one-win teams in 2013 and ’14 and missing almost all of ’15 with an injury, last season was sweet redemption for Sannon, a Florida native of Haitian descent who had never seen snow until Idaho lured him to campus with his only scholarship offer. Finally healthy, he had 303 receiving yards for a Vandals team that tied a program record with nine wins and brought home the school’s first bowl victory in seven seasons.&nbsp;The turnaround Sannon had signed up for four years before was well on its way. This fall,&nbsp;Sannon&nbsp;is Idaho’s leading receiver, and he has one last chance to make a mark before he runs out of eligibility—and his team is run out of FBS ball. <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/www.si.com/college-football/2017/10/19/idaho-vandals-sun-belt-fcs-realignment']);"" href=""https://www.si.com/college-football/2017/10/19/idaho-vandals-sun-belt-fcs-realignment"" target=""_blank"">Read more.</a> </td>

But a group of women engineering students at the University of Idaho is <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/engr/news/features/busting-national-trends"" target=""_blank"">trying to bust these statistics</a>. The students are part of U of I’s chapter of the Society of Women Engineers (SWE), a nationwide organization that performs K-12 and college outreach, along with professional development in the workforce to help women achieve their full potential in careers as engineers and leaders. SWE members have the chance to network with other women in the field, attend leadership conferences, learn about internship opportunities and go on industry tours. Today, Oct. 20, 2017, UI-SWE will work to inspire a younger generation of potential innovators during <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/engr/events/wie"" target=""_blank"">U of I’s Women in Engineering Day</a>, when up to 80 female high school students from Idaho and Washington visit UI to learn more about the discipline. <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/engr/news/features/busting-national-trends"" target=""_blank""><em>Read more.</em></a><br /> &nbsp; </td>

How do build a more vibrant economy and healthier communities? The University of Idaho believes that higher education offers the best pathway for a bright future. That’s why the university has been out in front of efforts to change the state’s college-going culture and promote post-secondary participation for several years. This fall, thanks to a university-wide effort, we have again seen positive results <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2017-october/102517-enrollment"" target=""_blank"">and an increase in enrollment</a>.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Overall enrollment at U of I has grown 2.4 percent for fall 2017, topping 12,000 students for the first time in five years. That increase includes notable gains in key areas, including a 3.9 percent increase in total resident enrollment, a 7.3 percent uptick in <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/admissions/international"" target=""_blank"">international student enrollment</a>, and an increase in underrepresented populations, including Hispanic and Native American student enrollment. International and underrepresented student enrollment are important measures of how our <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/academics/ipo"" target=""_blank"">global research university</a> cultivates a valued and diverse community.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> This fall we’ve also seen a significant, 23 percent increase in participation in dual-credit courses in our K-12 system. College students aren’t born, they are made: We can reach Idaho students with an experience that helps them develop as thinkers and leaders while they are in high school. They emerge <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/news/here-we-have-idaho-magazine/dual-credit"" target=""_blank"">prepared to succeed in college</a>, contributing right away to the classroom culture and using their accumulated credits to graduate on time. The U of I’s commitment to this <a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/exit/nextsteps.idaho.gov/']);"" href=""https://nextsteps.idaho.gov/"" target=""_blank"">statewide priority</a> continues to pay off.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Lastly, a comprehensive understanding of enrollment acknowledges the importance of retention, the rate at which students continue on from year to year toward graduation. This fall our freshman-to-sophomore retention rate stands at 82 percent, a 5 percent gain over last year, on par with the national average and the highest rate among Idaho public institutions. The U of I is continuing to invest in approaches that foster retention <span class=""st"">—</span> such as our <a href=""https://www.uidaho.edu/news/here-we-have-idaho-magazine/career-services"" target=""_blank"">Student Success Initiative launched in January 2017</a> <span class=""st"">—</span> and success through graduation and into a career.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> An educated citizenry is key to the university’s land-grant mission and to the aspirations of the state of Idaho. Challenges remain in areas such as growing new resident student populations, but the university is well-positioned to take on those challenges, thanks to the hard work of the entire Vandal community, from our teaching ranks to our recruiting teams to our advising staff. That university-wide dedication means that more students from Idaho and beyond come to know the U of I story as one of the best values in higher education <span class=""st"">—</span> a life-changing educational experience, at an affordable price, that prepares learners for lifelong success. </td>

Nels Reese <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/news-articles/news-releases/2017-october/102317-idahotreasure"" target=""_blank"">with the 2017 Idaho Treasure Award</a>. Awarded by the <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/faculty-staff/uira"" target=""_blank"">UI Retirees Association</a>, the Idaho Treasure Award recognizes retired university faculty and staff and their family members for contributions of leadership and service to the university.&nbsp;A native of Boise, Reese graduated from U of I in 1962 with a bachelor’s degree in architecture. He went on to receive a master’s in urban planning from City College of New York. His resume includes eight years spent in the Army National Guard, five years as art director for Army in Europe magazine while living in Heidelberg Germany, and seven years as director of facilities at U of I. Reese taught architecture at U of I for more than 20 years. His focus was primarily on urban design and planning and he led his students on numerous field trips, including to New York, to see architecture at work. A longtime public servant, Reese was appointed to Moscow’s Planning and Zoning Commission in 1996, a post he still holds today. </td>

But as an I&ntilde;upiaq Eskimo in Alaska, Rogers grew up in classrooms filled with mostly white students and white teachers, and that pride in her language wasn’t always shared. Being discouraged from speaking her native tongue was one of many experiences that spurred her desire to teach music education to Alaska Native students in the villages that make up the 49th state. “Growing up, I didn’t have role models who were Native,” said Rogers, 19, a sophomore music education major in the College of Letters, Arts and Social Sciences (CLASS) at the University of Idaho. She wants to better herself so she can be the best example possible for her fellow indigenous students. Jessica Matsaw has a similar goal. A senior finishing her bachelor’s degree in sociology with a minor in psychology in CLASS, Matsaw wants to take what she’s learned at U of I and apply it as a teacher on the Fort Hall Reservation in southeastern Idaho. Rogers and Matsaw are among a small group of Native American students at UI who are<a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/news/here-we-have-idaho-magazine/ikeep"" target=""_blank""> learning the best ways to serve Native communities through a cultural lens</a> as part of the <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/ed/resources/ikeep"" target=""_blank"">Indigenous Knowledge for Effective Education Program (IKEEP)</a>, run through the College of Education, Health and Human Sciences (CEHHS). </td>

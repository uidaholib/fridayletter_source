The Friday Letter is the University of Idaho's long-running, weekly message from the president to the university community. The University of Idaho Library captures items from the [Office of the President's web page](https://www.uidaho.edu/president) on an annual basis and select materials are made available in the [Web Archive Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/webarchive/).
For more information, please contact [Special Collections and Archives](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/contactus.html).

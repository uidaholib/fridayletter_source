For over two decades, The Friday Letter has been the University of Idaho's weekly message from the President to internal and external members of the university community. 
The Office of the President's website publishes a variety of official communications including the Friday Letter, Vandal Connection, reports, videos, and presentations.

To browse the collection, a [table]({{ '/' | relative_url }}) provides sorting and basic search.

The Friday Letter

The Friday Letter is U of Iâ€™s long-running, weekly message straight from the president to members of the Vandal family. Each week during the academic year, and with breaks for holidays, the president offers an update on Vandal teaching and learning, research and scholarship, and notable initiatives and priorities. Alumni and friends are welcome to join students, faculty and staff in receiving the newsletter.

Vandal Connection

The Vandal Connection is a quarterly digital newsletter directly from the president. Intended for people with a strong interest in the work of the university, the newsletter provides timely updates on progress toward goals, work on important initiatives, and the performance of critical programs. The Vandal Connection newsletter is issued twice in the fall academic semester and twice in the spring academic semester.

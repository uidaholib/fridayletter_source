For over two decades, The Friday Letter has been the University of Idaho's weekly message from the President to internal and external members of the university community. 
The Office of the President's website publishes a variety of official communications including the Friday Letter, Vandal Connection, reports, videos, and presentations.
To ensure continued access to this unique content, University of Idaho Library captures items in their original web context from the Office of the President's web page on an annual basis. 
Select materials are made available in the Web Archive Collections.

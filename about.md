# About {{ site.title }}

For over two decades, The Friday Letter has been the University of Idaho's weekly message from the president to internal and external members of the university community. 
Each week during the academic year, excluding holidays, the president sends updates on topics concerning the university such as teaching and learning, research and scholarship, and notable initiatives and priorities. 
The letter is sent via email to students, faculty, and staff in addition to Alumni and friends who elect to receive the newsletter.
